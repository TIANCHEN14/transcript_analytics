{"text": " rolling up front. Keep an eye out for that Penzel logo right about where the pace car is now. Yeah, I think that's a good marker. It could probably go just a little past that, but be a good judgment mark. So the the Penzel marker, obviously you just saw that the ZMAX is a little farther around, but you'll go behind the scoring pylon. That's about splitting the difference of the two. Maybe a shade a little closer to Penzel if you want me to call you there. I think the Penzel marker's fine. Just, you know, be on the aggressive end of it. Copy. Do you want that reminder? Uh, sure. Won't hurt nothing. All right, coming down this time. Two, second gear normal. And five and line. Five, four, three, two, and line. That was okay. Probably half light off of perfect. So I think I'll be just a little more aggressive than that. Hopefully. Copy. I'm watching the feed coming in. Looks a little slow. I'll let you know our back speed here in one sec. Yeah, I definitely, when I looked over at the box, I got slow in that section, which will be irrelevant. So I'll just know that, but I know it won't matter. Yeah, so you were slow the first half pit road. You looked pretty good second half. The fastest segment was at the end of pit road at 49.7, which is perfect. Yeah, I'll be just a little better than that. I think coming to one to go. All right, let's go get it today. Dig in, go to work. Appreciate all the efforts so far. Got a good piece. Execute all day here, fellas. Copy that. Work through it here. Nice and smooth all day. Behind the 47 is the 12. Behind the 77 on the outside is the 99. All right, here we go. Paste cars off. Now, five and green. Row into U quarter off. Still there. Outside three, your bottom three, bottom three, still bottom three, still three. Now just two at the 20. Three bottom. Three, three, three bottom. Still three bottom. Still three, still, still, still, still three bottom. Now just two at the 77. 20 is rolling the top hard. You're still two. Keep coming. All good. Two wide now. Just the 54. Stay away from him here. Just you two. Run coming to your bumper here. The 45. He's in line. Still out there. Even. Still, still out there. Door. Tight to you. Two by two. Two back. Now three with the 34. You're going to be good on entry. All clear there. Still out there. Barely. Still, still, barely. Still there. Coming back to you. Door. Door still. Come in even. 77. Two back watching. For the run. One back. 77. Out there. Still out there. Clear. Clear up. Clear up. Still clear up. Gotta get up. He's coming outside. Out there. 77 is in line with him.

Right with you. Inside. Nothing behind you. Two for ten. Still there. Still clear. Clear. Pull in top. You're all good. All good. He's just shading a glaring higher back corner behind you. There are more room now. Nothing doing up top still. Allen, I'm trying to get my telemetry working up here. Careful. Light grip. Entry wheel in place. All day. Austin, easy off here. Front stretch. Bottom here. He was up by the wall. I'm not sure if it was a tire or oil. That's ten laps in. Chase, nobody had gone up to the top and done anything. Everybody was bottom bottom. Yeah, copy. I think my entry security is in a pretty good place. I could get a little tight. I think most of that is traffic. So I don't think it's in a bad spot. Yeah, copy that. Inputs thus far. I look really good. P-11, I got my stuff up here working out. Open this time. Copy. Come on to us here. Copy. Second gear normal. Stop you back here. We'll stop you back. You have two clean stalls in. We'll stop you back. Ten. Five and line. Four and fuel here. Four and fuel. Four and fuel. Five, four, three, two. Go, go, go, go. All the way. All the way. All the way. All the way. All the way. Normal. And a line. I count 11. Yeah, that was a good job. Real good job. Anybody else here in that key up? I do. Talk to me about lanes here when you get it. I have two. That's Alan keying up on one. We can't hear him. Somebody down here is keying up. I haven't heard Alan. Have you, Dre? No, I have not. I told Mark on two that if he was keying up, we couldn't hear him. We're coming to one this time, P-11. Technical difficulty. Six top, five bottom. I think there's five right in front of you. Five right side tires. All right, here we go. Choose them. Leader took the bottom. One top, two top, three, four, five. You're a six. Your lane up top is the 14 on the point. 45, five, 24. Then you can see the two there. Behind you is the 47. Behind him is the 34. Behind the 54 on your left rear is the 12. 15 complete when we get it. Five and great. All that you got here. Clear bottom if you want it. Still there on your quarter. Rolling back even. 54, 47 is right with you. Come up and push. Bottom stacking up here. Tight. 47 is looking mid. Three, you're three top. Three top. Three top. Still, still, still. Still three top. Still three top. Still three. Still three. Still three. Still three. Still three tight below you. Two tight below you. You're still three top. Push coming to you here. This is 77. Still, still three. Still three. Still three. Still three tight down below you. Still. Clear mid. Two wide, one inside. Clear bottom. Get in there quarter. Clear bottom. Back in there. Door three. Three top. Run coming to you. 34. Just you and the 54. 34 is coming. Come on the run to you. She's on your door. 34. 34 is right with you. 54 had to get out of it there. You're clear bottom. Clear to cross. All good. Still there. Still there. Clear. Still good. All good. Nice job. All right. Enter wheel and pace here. Get in your rhythm. They're racing hard behind you. Four back to 47 and the 54. Just keep doing what you're doing. More room now. 54 cleared to 47 but you got him by about eight. 54 is closed into five back. He's running the mid one and two and mid three and four. He's still three back. Miss you looking high. In line. Shot mid. You're all good up. Coming to you here. Watch him shoot bottom. Nice job there. Killed his run. You and him. You and him. 54 is not going to get you. It's just going to be you and him. Clear. Clear by half. Up. Clear. Just fast. 54 cleared him to the mid. Two back. Down here again. Got him by two. All good. Run coming to you. He's going to shoot bottom. In there. All good behind him if you want it. Keep going. You're good. All good. They'll get it out here. Keep coming. Easy. Easy. Easy. Still just a little tight. I mean I'm in a really comfortable position so I don't want to ruin that. But I'm just a little tight like across the center and off. Kind of in the banking I would say. Can you say it for me? What's your ride? Have you felt anything there with your ride? No it's been no issue this far. 11.11. Down to 17. Take two there. Still closed. Come on to us. Stage two. Second gear normal. Foreign fuel two clean in. We'll stop you short. Head away. Five and line. Five four three two one. Go go all the way. All the way. And a line. A line. You guys took two I think. What's that? That's 17. That three stay out. The 99, the 34, and the 42. Nine top eight bottom here. Just clean these tires up real good. They're going to red flag this thing. They're having to weld on the wall and turn one. So update me on the strategy side here. Obviously a lot of people took two. It looks like some even stayed. So you got three that stayed out. Then you've got some one that Luke said five or six would take right. And then yeah four. You know obviously we're bleeding track position which isn't ideal so hopefully we can run long enough here to get that back. Yeah I assume these are scuffed or something. Yeah copy. And then fuel's good to the end. Are the people that stayed out not? They are. They're going to be waiting on gas at the stage but yeah we're awake and we would have been right at it if we wouldn't have stopped. While we're chatting how about some input stuff? I'll pull that up here. Give me one second. I'm going to switch a car. Yeah so I think still the same thing. You know I'm assuming you need to be a little freer to run the middle more effectively and then same thing. We just got to get away to carry just a little more throttle into three there. Yeah I mean honestly a lot of my event count up handcuffed a little with traffic but I think I could do better if it ever strung out too I think. Yeah I think just scrolling through here just trying to get obviously I don't know exactly what traffic is doing to you but just trying to get more shape on that entry and less you know more wheel earlier less later. Way improved here with what we have been but that would be a step taking forward. I've been a little short on reminders just because it hadn't really got going but I'll get better at that. It's been good that's a good amount. They're finishing up they're going to throw us back yellow here in a bit but I'll let you know when they roll up front. Taste car is rolling. Coming to one and the choose nine top eight bottom here. Leader bottom one two top three four five top six seven eight your nine behind the 12 and your lane is the 48 behind the 47 on the bottom is the one. Tires off. They're jamming up a little there.

the 23 still still still still tight on you still there door tight on you even joey's in your rear shoe bottom three now two with the 22 48 in your mirror still there barely still there still there 48 still with you 48 bottom one back inside here clear clear clear clear tight grip here enter wheel and pace theme lane the one entered on the wall and three that last lap he just got past the 48 come with a run one back of you shoe bottom here inside three wide in front of you there one ran the fence last time three still three just two at the one two at the one still there it's on you he went back higher running the third lane behind you two back he's going to come with a run here to you one back half ah good runner though keep working that good corner even with you here 48 come on the run back to you one back half back 48 right with you clear by two and a half most everybody's bottom to mid the 48 just ripped the wall behind you know what you know what it looks like he didn't gain a whole lot it's such a big run down the front all clear up he's back on the wall all good up run coming to you here run coming to you here half back outside outside outside just the 48 clear behind him 12 is in your mirror he's probably going to shoot bottom here half back two with the 48 just two wide with the 48 watch him looking low in there inside all right got 10 light grip entry wheel and pace focus on that entry a few ahead of you are starting to run the fence the three and four one and two the one is running the third lane making it work he's the only one doing it 34 heads on no tires 14 inside now you're clear of him up here all clear all good all good by three flow up by the wall all these guys are coming back to you don't let them slow you down go where they're not 24 in your mirror is a lap down side 24 good corner good corner there still there still still still out there 61 complete 61 going to 85 sorry going to 80 80 coming back with a run outside on the fence clear with you right here run to your bumper right with you that corner behind you five now you're doing good here laying out some decent lap times keep focusing on your entry all right tight good exit door quarter still quarter coming back even all good all clear everybody's searching around leaders has been running bottom one and two mid three and four he just went back to the bottom at three and four eight grip entry wheel and pace you're faster than the leader that last lap and he's in clean air clear next car ahead is very slow clear your room 10 back on the 99 focus on your entry 15 15 five to go on the stage that's lab is faster than the leader so coming to the stages next time by faster than the leader again green checker here pushes out for balance that run well i mean the beginning was tight and you know typically i would miss my exit but it's something i'm doing i think more than anything because then i my right rear got really pumped up yeah there later on so i thought those last couple i was starting to better understand but i was also compensating for a overbuilt right here so copy that i think just a game inches you know just pushing that into a little bit trying to stay off that brake challenging those front tires early but yeah good job here make some progress for closed his last couple laps like my wheel any similarity at all to the leader or is that just same shit just happened to be making some time and he probably wouldn't try he was trying the 45 was with him racing him for the stage win so i think you're you're doing the right things i think it's just that struggle with traffic right is trying to stay off the brake challenge that entry you know we've got less wheeling and more in the center just trying to shift that back a little bit as much as you can let us know what we can do for the car to help that yeah that's where i'm just struggling a little bit because yeah at the beginning i just was missing my exit tight and then i think that got my right rear built up you know me trying to make it turn and then that was you know once i got it pumped up that made me struggle to turn in a little bit more i was a little sharp on entering so it's a little bit of a domino i think and i think it's all just from traffic i think traffic you know it's tough which is challenging that entry speed not giving up time with those guys that's you know you we just give up a little bit too much and actually just can't make it back on exit and then those fuckers like that 71 air blocking like crazy or 77 whoever you know we just gotta do that back still closed road i said about the five and the 45 chase yeah yeah your last three laps of the stage to him you were just about a tenth better each lap open this time come on to us your foreign fuel foreign fuel to clean in hit the side we'll stop you back and going on tires you've been about a foot off the line wide so if you can help us out there copy now five and line five four three two one so go go go go clear clear clear clear formal and i count 12 off pit road six six on your lanes good job here you got a little better track position just think about what you got to do here move forward as lab 85 we're going to 165 for this stage when that one was making time at the top to see have that first like pull on the wheel same thing when he runs the very very top we'll go look but the biggest thing i noticed is he's killing a bunch of pace in there i'll go back and look to yeah it's interesting now because i'm i'm over slipping the right front like that's when i missed those wide exits just because i drove through and i'm just trying to piece together how to get that descending wheel you know more so the lap he got that big run off the top to your bumper to you he just didn't have a lot of wheel on entry no a lot of throttle in and more right than i thought he used a brake uh but he carried the throttle deep kind of like switched it use a brake back to it his wheel was pretty flat yeah got me all right coming in to use six and six he said yeah six and six with advantage top i'd say 12 split you there three on that last restart you see that coming i'm even i'm telling you like do you want me to tell you to get up top to block it are you okay with it that's fine it was fine because i i felt like yes i was watching copy all right here's your choose one top two three four five six if you could sum up an aggressive row it's going to be behind you on this restart you're going to have host of our in your beer and he's going to have the one the 45 is behind the 77 in your lane the 10 is behind the one in the top take cars off five and green this ship behind you are all good all good here just two with the 12 tight ahead here come down three four staggered four staggered four four three two now two with the 14 clear top still two you're going to be two here now maybe three with the one just two yep just bottom here still there bottom still still just the 14 23 come

fast as the leader stay after it here 14 inside looking clear light grip here breathe buddy entry wheel at pace focus on it corner more room the leaders are bottom down here side 14 all clear a little gust here up here and there all clear focus on that entry pace what's about your car where do you get a second i'm doing the same shit i don't know it's just really hard for me to tell you what to do and i know i'm not doing it right coffee we five and one five four three two one go go go go go go all the way all the way all the way horrible and the body got one coming shoulder clear up behind him

with a hard run with you you still there all clear all clear all good run your line here all good all victories here maybe steps on gaining on this thing you got it clear don't let them stop their momentum clean lanes and drive it in get around them your p10 right here one zero 127 complete one one all room four bike for a clean line here on entry here so clear all good clear good good by half all good all good nice job focus on that 22 focus on your entry face that exit behind more room now light grip entry that corner look good full room now out back eight to ten here's got just a little later turn down in both corners simple entry just turns down a little later your 20 left in the stage 20 your p9 keep focusing on that entry light grip i like that line through one and two it looks good every time you run it i grip here focus on your entry face extend that straight away a little you want is behind the seven on tires just trying to help get him up to you there's two by two four back just cleared him he has not full position the next car behind you is a lap down focus on everything forward still p9 here tentacle the stage two back one coming with a run just out easy here easy one around on the back straight away i felt better there i definitely built up the right front too much though um the good news was i kept the build out of the right rear i can tell from the ride quality so i don't i don't think that was a bad spot um i just got stuck i want the 22 kind of beat the right front off of it can i copy that looks like it's open here once it's open come on to us here yeah it's open five and five four three two one go go go go all the way all the way and how many left here in the stage it's going to be five when you come around so so probably yeah five or five or so when you get it here on the time it's messed up on the tv but information for me better worse not different that time better the only critique i have is when you run up on guys and that's how that 77 got you is just using too much brake and slowing down they wrote a recorder there so just try to not do that i know it's tough picking lanes you're trying to go where they're not but if you check that momentum it just kills your opportunity copy that was 159 across the line there we come into 160 would make it five but i don't it'll probably be four three or four like alan says eight when they clear in the cycles here here i'm into your shoes five here five and five sorry five top three bottom my bad five top three bottom leader bottom two top three top your four top here are the points on right let's get a good restart here get some points this feels like one of those front foot attack moments seven's in your mirror the 24 is in his the 19 has the three and the 14 on the bottom all right when you get it it's going to be four stars off and out five and easy great hey with you watch them man out watch the top you're four four four four four tight four four still four

times but i think it was a little more proper so we're staying here see that can you tell how much wind here it's gotten in the car chase a little bit here and there open this time good for staying here staying up uh way around coming by coming to one and you choose by the numbers four top two bottom it seems a little strong is that today numbers yeah that's today the 48 really you know struggled there on the bottom on two so i'm skewing it choose i'm here later bottom one top two top here's three top the 19 has the three and the 43 you have the 22 and the 14 all right think about

better than joey and i really liked my balance to to push him and challenge him you know i just couldn't did make it happen feeling great here get a good crack at it here another good track at it i don't have a ton to complain about i mean i can kind of get tight there across the center and then i work hard and get the right rear pumped up you know my ride quality goes away security gets a little worse but i'm still you know i still kind of battle tight across the center even with the even with the right rear pumped up sometimes so i don't know it's it's a little i'm just not not there yet after that you're doing great here doing great just focus on finishing here it's open come on to us here foreign fuel hit the sign to clean in closed open this time come on to it's your foreign
