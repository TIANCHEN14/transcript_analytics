{"text": " You can fire it up on your radio, I'll let you know when they roll. Go ahead and run it the whole time. I said you can run it the whole time please. We are rolling up front. I'll call out your 10 away, we're a little bit on the curb. Remember it goes open 99 and then you... break in the wall in front of Briscoe's box, probably be your easiest reference. Alright, you are 10 away right here. Next break is about three before you. Alright here. It will be tough for Wilson to pick you up so if we need to change anything we'll keep you posted. I'm going to try and cut down on the curb, see if my speeds are there as well. Copy. Your pace car is middle three and four. Your pace car is out of the dog leg. Look at your restart zone and your two's right here. Here's your restart zone and two's. Your pace car is at pit road speed back there. Let me know what you got, make sure it's close. Alright, remember that starts and restarts you've got to stay above the yellow line, full start finish line. Start to get you single file the dog leg, we'll do the speed check this time. Remember your page, speed check. Your brake fans, couple abs in or on now or anything. Seven green at your marker. Lights now. Ten away. Two, one, now coming to one to go. Field off to you. Was it aggressive, was those all wanting to be there? Alright yeah that actually looked really good. The only concern is the first section you were at forty nine nine. Past that it was all forties, fifties, you got one sixty. But everything honestly looked really good as far as the check. No concerns except for the first section. First section, how's the curb? Initially you drop down to a forty eight, but then you come right back up to a forty nine three. There's a forty eight eight but then right back to a forty nine four. So it's hard to tell you to adjust much because it's kind of back and forth and the high side is good. Copy, running eight green Doug, call out eight green today. Eight green. Alright guys, long day ahead, have a smart race. Be aggressive when we can be. Go to work here, thank you for the hard work. Copy that, a lot of hard work, good crew, gonna need you guys today. Let's move forward. Alright just make sure you can't be all four below this commitment box right here exiting two. I know it's rare but just a thought. Copy. Line till start finish going to sixty. Make sure everything's where you need it, nothing out back your lane. Leader bottom, he is ten away. Five, extra mark slowing it down, going late, going very late, jammed up, green, we're rolling, tight jammed but rolling, jammed but rolling. All good, room in front. Tight front, still inside, two to your left, two lanes down to your left, one inside the seven. Seven, one to the four, one lower, half. Just inside, very bottom, three top.

Middle open, just the three, clear high. Out back fifteen, lane lower. Still inside, three. Still there with the forty one, we're up to seventy one if needed, just the forty one, room exposed if needed.

Anything? Left front's been killed. Very bad Wolf, just try to take care of it. Two assists time. Just watch the three, I won't come around you. Guys, it's obviously left front, so we're just going to jack the left side up, it's going to be Sol, Maynard, stretch going over the wall, focused on the left front. You're going to run the gun, or Maynard, you run the gun to get the left front off. Car's already into two, ten away. Get the left side up here, left side up. Upright is broken, we're done. Right back to the garage from here. Best route would be to limp around on the apron. I can do that as long as we don't feel like the tire's going to fall apart or nothing. For a minute, Pitt Road's going to be open this time, pace car's into one. Garage. There we go, we did the right things today. Copy. Moving forward there, it definitely looked good there in the start, I appreciate you getting after it there. Good title, I just know when we can limp back, the quickest way back to the garage is on the timer first, so I think it's best to go forward. That's fine. You'll make sure you stay safe with these cars coming around here. Back in, coming up Pitt Road now, full wings up and clear and then we kill. Stretch wants to get a toad here. Just want to get a toad. We're not going to get that left front out there. Going in the car. Pop out. Good truck. Go ahead and pop out. Stay out here, let you guys know where they end up until I lose them in the garage. They're going in the back, park one entrance to the garage. They're by like the Stewart Haas boxes in the garage area. The 21 Hauler and the Collig Hauler, they're going to be that way back by Goodyear. I think the 17's the best, getting screwed on pit stops right now. Did it follow our notes, like moved up middle of the stage? Both ends, then move it back down to the bottom, exactly what we saw. Then you go back down and play it dirtier. The best car is making the apron work one and two, which is 17 I think, dirtier. To move up when he needs to for traffic. It's like it's moving less. Like this time in the fall rate, we were running up top ten laps in per lap time. Where's everyone showing the model? It took longer to move up in three and four. I still think more should be up in one and two than I'm seeing right now. I think it's there. I think that goes with what we saw after practice. Like it didn't move as much in practice. It didn't seem like it was going to move as much in the race. Even now there's not a ton of rubber down. I'd say the track color's the same. But I think guys not moving up, I'm not really convinced it's a track limitation thing. Like we talked about this morning, just like loud, probably the fourth time they haven't treated it. Where you're not having as much of a grip benefit to the track distance loss. Your top seven or eight have been bottom for a very long time, if not almost that entire run. I mean, I'm not convinced from Busch or on back with loose time moving up over here three and four, rather than just following the people in front of them into the pink. I think that's where you've got to watch, like a Brisco or some of these other guys to see if it moves up. I think the fact that Brisco didn't even move up there tells me that it's not quite good enough. Like Kyle Busch has been up there, but he's been loose in spots too. I'd say if you can get the bottom and someone moves up and you've got clean air on your nose, it's like Merry Christmas. Like that one time Zane tried to run in the middle and I got on the bottom and passed three of them in a one, two, easy. It's really good in the apron one and two, but the difference between him and Brad was Brad saw him coming, moved out of there and Busch was parked. I think Brad learned that being in front of me in practice. I was honestly glad as much practice as we had to run, or traffic, how much traffic we had to run in practice. Just get an idea of how limited that would be. That was a positive, like we wouldn't have gotten to do that on a Group A, Group B day. He had to fall off because today the Ralph Cartes came alive at the end. Once four fell off later in the run, he had to move around. That's what the 17 benefited. He was stuck to the line the whole time and got clean air and had speed. I think he's one of the best right now. His limit is versatility. I compare to guys buried in the field because to me if you're anywhere in the top five or six you're not giving me a good reading of what the racetrack is doing. Thank you, that's how fast Danny is right now doing that. Kyle's the highest. I haven't seen anyone as high as that yet. I'm running that many laps consecutively up high. Finally gave up to the guy on the bottom. Let's see what the 19 does here. Just give them probably move back to the bottom since it's been so bad up top. In the last two laps all I've done was pull the 19 to me now. I'm pulling Reddick's finally faster than Danny down here by about a tenth of a 35 laps in. This lazy line the whole time. Reddick was up the last two laps doing that. It's the only time he's been up. It's interesting to me because I call that splitting the first team. If not just above it. I feel like that's a no man's political thing. I'm close to these guys. You see that dealer in between first and second team? I'm close to these guys. I'll be either right or left on it. Too high. Right here. And whatever they put down stays more and more like a loud shift and it's more into play than Reddick. Over here anyway, three and four. This thing between the two of us that both of us can't have a good day at the same time. It just gets more and more extreme. Street's not broken. I like him at all but I'm ready for him to have a bad one. Reddick's going to launch. He does the same thing. I really think he's better than Brad. He drove up to Brad, made up ten positions and Brad got plus three on the pit stop. Chris went minus three. Brad drove Chris's line once he got two on the pit stop. This can both pivot. Right at the O'Reilly right here, the last one. Really strong on the bottom when they run it. It's interesting. Watch Brad. And the last O'Reilly. You get in like in that trough and you're just hooking the line. That's where like here you have to be really good on the long run, ramp on the bottom or else it's pointless to run it. It gets to the point where guys just start to give up and just try to run higher. You can't do that. It's kind of a very good car. It's strong. If we're to watch some point before we come back, those guys make it move to go to the field, it'd be both of them, especially me. Still playing with that sealer. Hey, post rate, do you think it's easier for me to walk from here to the parking lot or should I get a ride with Lynn and go to the bus line and walk in? Bus lot. She had more color at that middle seam right now. And it's just more and more guys not being able to wrap the line. He's running in my opinion, it's pointless. Like once, maybe he won't do it the next time, but he's running like half a lane up and three and four, just trying to air block the seven. There's like a little bit lower, just get all the way to the bottom. The man's plan just dead strumming, that seemed like blaney. Like that was, that was a good thing. I think it's a good thing. There's like a little bit lower, just get all the way to the bottom. The man's plan just dead strumming, that seemed like blaney. Like that was air blocked basically, just couldn't get to the bottom, would that happen? No. Thank you for your Merry Christmas. Wait. Wait, so we're gonna be closed? I'm gonna take that rocket boat back up. Photo of a fan, like the one before, lap 120, 115. Photo monitoring as Kyle's doing it on purpose. Fixed your first mover, probably gonna benefit from it. Car fell back pretty hard? Assuming that's a pit stop. Oh, he's still going, he ain't pit yet. And yeah. Before that he was nowhere where he qualified. Yeah, he lost about four or five the first run as well. Yeah. You haven't said something about him being a new guy? To me that doesn't happen, Redick has the lead right now, he was the first one to move up. Is that because of Danny Ketchum traffic? Or is this because he's the first one to move up? Like I said, track limitation, it's there earlier. Theoretically it should have worked better last run than this run now that it's got rubber down on it. I agree, they're also. He's gonna try that again. He's just out there supporting tires better. Kyle's really doing it. He's tired. You're like, sound out of his idea based off one interview. Best all weekend. Boy, nah, not so much. I'd say now that the track has rubbered in a significant amount, the 17 has slowed down. On top of the fact he can't move around it'd be as good compounding as this year. Yeah, I think based off of what I've seen right now, this follows our trends, it's way less extreme. Danny, last part. This follows our trends, it's way less extreme. Yeah, I ain't scared to be the first one to move up, Redick's proven me that. He takes that transition, I'm not scared to be the first one after a refire. Surprise seems to be the only one really doing it aggressively still at this point. One's committed to that 20 lap mark, because they're scared. 54 was probably one of the strongest cars at the end of the run. He lost a bunch of ground pit stops to 14 right now, I want to see where he ends up at the end of the stage. He's in with clean air just as fast as the leader, Navi, P50. He's a 30 laps in, pain fast as well. We'll be right back. Surprise over here, you want anything? I'm going to eat today. Shit too. Best case scenario here is that Ryan Feddickson's well enough to go to tech, and I'm playing the takeout order a while, flower. I feel bad. We've got the stewardess giving McSally's on the point now per request. Contract? Definitely darker. They're just now coming alive, Navi, guys move up. They're now also really good right now, making my time. So far ahead of everyone else. Did you ever just take a piss as a leader? I don't have confidence like that. Oh, you ever did that? Ready, move up 34, slow down on 10, Navi, 40, and finish. They're the fastest car. By like three tenths. This is Steve-Alk, coming alive, Steve-Alk coming clean in there, him in the 24. Sorry. They're comparing him to the 20 in the 24, they'll have clean air for a while. I've seen a lot of moments out of brochure as far as sliding rears. They also had bad air almost the majority of the time until lately, and I don't see the fall off like if he build up like I would suspect. It's not even enough for his right rear to be bad at him. I've got just a 38, he has yet to hit. That might close it, but all I hear is static. I've got just a 38 running. He's not even hit, I'm just curious from a tire wear perspective, this is like, past the extreme. 29.50, leader of the 30. He's like Lugano right now. 9.50, cars are teething. This way, everyone that ran long and did hit is one down rather than him just staying. Fuel only or something here. I don't see him stand on the late lap, but it was also bad enough that he would have already been a lap down. They're pinned right now. I know that works for him. He has a 47 against him. Your pick is perfect still. 26, plus 8, the first run. Phoenix guy, I guess. Can we go to here a 183? Right up there off 2 is an invasion that used to be, gets worse as the stuff fades more. This one was higher than I've seen anybody all day. It was like, I'm coming with off the wall. I think this is going to be poetry watching Lugano try and hold on to what he was leading last year. This should be a show. I want to spend radius all day on two years. Saying I'm always right, but I would have been everything in my life in this corner. The 22 is going to be on the line the next time we got here. He's got around the 9, he's got clean air. Thank you. Redica 36 with the P.O. Mary booth. More comparable to the biggest factor of lifetime traffic. 21 car, same lap as the leader. 28. Clear. Inside. Clear. You can spot for the 20. They're taking Bragg-Buscher and track through the 20. They're taking Bragg-Buscher and track through the 20. They're going to have to be at least compete with the top three. Clear fashion car, the Bragg-Buscher. I'll put a 12 on the 12 to keep it relevant. See ya. Big. That looked like something happened. John Hunter. Hit. Definitely hit the wind knocked out of him when he spoke. That could be the best thing that could happen to not have to deal with John Hunter anymore. That'll be handled. Definitely get handled. I don't know if he would have landed that. I mean, I thought maybe okay, maybe does he like come in front of his nose like, but he was on the apron the whole way through. That must have been something from last prior. Who Coleman says. He's grabbing right rear. That's over. That's over. Four is standing. That's the 12 car the rest of it. That's what relieved me. You're stuck with me for another three at least. Dead-o. Dead-o. Two tires on the 54. The 20 car is the furthest one forward on four tires. So, I mean, 50 last left. Probably could win this thing. I'd say as good as he was on the long run. I'm curious if he can catch the 19. I don't think so, but obviously Carl should make it totally different. I want to see where the 41 ends up in the water. Yeah, pretty big gap. 19, I have to catch the lap traffic for the VA race. For the VA race. The traffic will save the 20. I think the 19 is not as strong at the end of the run. The traffic will slow down. The elbow battle increases 38 to 14. That's about right. He's been working this entire stint for this pass. Oh, Toyota's move up and carry speed the most. They're their most versatile cars I think, the JTR. That's why them and the 45 are the only ones we've seen up through the pack at all. The speed's there as well, but that looks like it was pretty important to them. I'd say the characteristics of their braking on entry definitely helps with that. I heard it. I think he's going to catch him. Yeah, he's going to catch him. Is that Delta? 10. I don't see a line though. 4.8 That's like the 19, he's not going to be able to make it. 10, four and a half seconds. He pit at 190. He saved both those last two, right? That's that, Mac Nugget. Classic Ross to run 15th all day and be in the top five by the end of the race. There's smoke in the fence. The crutch is still, he can't move around the speed. The 24th and I got buried, zero recovery. At speed, that's why I say the first two. Danny's just now going to get to Gildan. Team at one are equal tires. Four's on two. Alright, I'm going to go down and find Nelson.
