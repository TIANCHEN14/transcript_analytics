{"text": " Start and roll. You're okay on the antenna. A lot of traffic on Pace Labs. He was a little shitty to me. He stopped maybe a little before that depending on the pace. You can miss the box here if you're wide to your right. Left all day. Yellow flashing orange. Hit the line now. Start looking left in three, two, one, see him? Spot on. I flashed red once. That segment after our box. Everything right on the money there. Run those all day. I'm gonna go this time. You got your alternator. You can go in here if you want it. You know how I feel about the great state of Texas. Let's go have fun. Let's go have a good day. Let us know what you need in here and we'll take care of you. Second lane. Burned in here quick about where you're at now. Just run tight down here. Stay nice and patient with everything. Have a good day. Three, two, one. Rolling, rolling. Green. Green again. All the way. One gap behind you. Here's your line now. Tight front. Still wind up down there. Still inside one gap behind is a 77. Still your quarter in. There just you and him. No help by about three behind you. Still quarter in. Still there. Jump clear. Clear by a foot. Clear, clear, clear. And still there. Clear, clear, clear. Come sorry. Alternator back when you can. Drop back. Switches, fans, alternator, all that stuff when you can here. You're good by about six behind of the one. Stay with it. Looks like he's struggling down there. Just a hair. Really the first one to start working that down there. I'll let you know when more start going in. It starts coming in. You're both better than the two ahead of you. Hopefully it just kind of starts slowing down. So he can start making some headway with passes. Similar to yesterday. A little bit but for the most part. Just kind of tightly dirty air. He's having to be really lazy to the gas to keep wrapping the bottom. So we'll see how his stuff trends. Five times you're okay. Keep working on him. Please. It's just stuck. The timing and scoring is down too. He's been struggling all day. I don't know if it's an app issue or a connection issue. So just a heads up. Was a gain for his exit. Last entry into one was a gain for your exit. Sounds like it's a connection issue up here with everybody. So he'll probably be in and out today. But forget now. Bottom is still the only two ahead of you that are trying anything different. That's 20 there. Let me know if you got anything different. It's about the same. It just doesn't seem to be any good to drive in the corner. Packed up right on him. Maybe he'll miss it. We'll get him. Keep chipping away. He's gone through three and four again. He's been two apart. He still lost a ball that wasn't as bad as before. So he's trying to science it out there. I know you've got to do opposite of him but some guys can stay out just a little wider if that helps you pulling across his wake at any point. It'll be uncomfortable. They're really hard in the corner. Gotcha. More behind you running the second lane through one and two. Just going opposite of what they got going on ahead of them. Up there. Again in one if he don't go top. No warning at all. There's a waving behind us. Coming. Couple ahead, Cain. Hit this time. Keep coming. Ready now. Three, two, one. Now. Away. You're looking left at three, two, one. On your side. Go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go. Not yet. You're good on him. Four back to the top here. It's the four by himself. We're all good. Hopefully I didn't fuck you up. Stupid fucks told me they were pitting the next lap. So I would have ran around another lap. We're riding around in clean air. No reason to do that. Stay with it here, man. We'll get there. Sorry about that. They told us they were running one more lap. All clear. Everything you can. 77 got real tight behind you. All out front. I'm pretty bad in front of you. Good laps here, man. Eyes forward. We'll go get it back. There is the leader. Has not pitted yet. Three ahead of you. Hopefully the 17 is ahead of him and we'll get the dog. Our car is really good. We're just going to have to get the track position back. But our car is really good. Clearly ahead of the nine. Nine and the 17. Fire off on green flag cycle. Everything do what you want it after a few laps. For maybe three laps or so. And then just got tight. As soon as I got to those guys. Yeah, 10-4, man. I like what I see. Sorry, I was a stack up of everything wrong. He came up here and told me they were coming a lap after us. Then he stopped short and we slid along and downhill from there. We'll wave here. Obviously 17 is your lucky dog. We're still sitting 19th with all of this. We'll get re-racked and get to the stage and get what we can. Well, guys, I'm going to guess the back half of those lead lap guys will come get tires. But there's going to be some of those guys that had run long. You know, that I don't think are great cars. I think we can still, you know, we have potential to chip away. There's going to be more than half the field waving around here. We're the first wave. I'm just going to need a car count in front of us. The five as the leader, once the pit cycle is done, just start counting behind him. Does that make sense? I'll give you a number. 23rd in line. Behind the 17 and choose after him. 23rd in line. I bet he lines up right there. They got to move the 17 behind 84. This bottom is 2. 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 134, 33, 19, 17, behind 77, 39, 22, everybody on our lap here. So a lot of mixing tires in front behind. Come back to 25 to go, whatever you need. To go to the end of the stage. Stay in line until you get there. You ready? In 3, 2, 1, and go, go, go, all the way. Here's your line now. The 2 is kind of stuck. Still in there. Just clear low here if you want it. Clear low. 17 tight with you. You're clear low. You're going to need one back here. Bottom 17 tight with you. 16 only up top rolling up there. Still clear up. Main quarter out. Quarter out. Tie behind. Tie behind. 17 only by 3. Your door out there still. Quarter clear. In line clear. You and him. One back 17 with you. Just there. Just there. Just clear. Clear, clear. All the way clear. Clear if he hasn't. By half. In line. Slow run. Still in line. Half. All good. Still there. Still there. With you even Jimmy. In line. Tight out back. Out right only. Still quarter. Clear. Clear. Clear. All the way. You're getting in up top. Use your G-sail rather than brake if you can. Secure it if you have to. Back. Just a little run. Half in line. Tight with you. Out of line bottom. Right with you. On your bumper. Still good. Still good. Insider. By himself. About 6. 15 more to the stage. Clear. Okay. We see a couple of them tanking up there. Run. Have 15 lap holder or newer tires in order to catch them. We're doing okay here man. We'll get you to them very shortly. 5.2 When I moved up the first time it was like it wasn't ready and I couldn't stick the right rear on exit. It was tight on the bottom but as I moved up I wanted to I would cheer kind of late. We just felt tight. Other than that I could snap it a little bit. Exit at 2 but pretty tight. Okay. 1 is a lap down. 19 will be in his box. That's who will be coming around before we get here. If I help your center exit just a tick you can still be able to get in the corner okay. My entry to 1 I don't know what the best way to go about that is. A little bit of just overall grip and then we got something that I think we can touch center exit specifically. So I'll take a stab here. A few tweaks and it's still really good man. Close. Open this time. It's about to box in. Opening and then 33 ahead of him. He's real early on pit road. Right on right, left on left. Flash orange. 33 stayed out. He stayed out at the line. 10 away. 19 and 2. 1 on your sign. 1 out. 1 out. 1 out. To the grass right here. To the grass right here. There's your lane. You got a penalty cab. Just give me a count when you get rid of him. Copy. P19. P19. P19. P19. P19. P19. P19. P19. P19. P19. I got 4 on 2 tires. And 4 or 5 that stayed out. So. What do you prefer for lane choice right now? Pop or short it. Close. The numbers 9 will be choice. So 9 top, 10 bottom. Alright. 9 top, 10 bottom. Counting top. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 4 near me. Coming to the green. 2, 1 and rolling, rolling, rolling. Here's your line now. Tight with you. 4 is tight with you in line. Inside only. Down in there. Half back half higher to the 4. It's fading. No in only. In only. You're good up top. No run up top. In only. So 2 wide. Clear down here. Clear down. Clear down. And in. And in. And in. Inside 4. Half back top. Inside only. Still there. Just clear all the way. One gap bottom here after Ricky. Still inside. Clear behind him if you need it. 1. It's gone. They're lined up under there. Still in here. Nothing happened to 31. Still inside. Just trailing here. Quick gap bottom after the still. Still real fast. Half with you in. Inside now. Inside. Half back half higher. Outside your middle 3. Middle 3. One only each way. Still mid. Clear low. Even out. Just doing the 4. Only there. Clear behind. Half higher. Trying to make a run but you're good up. You're good up. Still good. Still good. Still good. With you 42. With you. Order clear. All clear. Behind him again. Frustrating. Stay with it here man. We'll be okay. Still out there. Just you and him. We'll be able to wrap the bottom like we can. So I think he's smart here. We'll start picking him off. 3. Door. Quarter. Just clear. Just clear. You're good. All the way. Still good. Still good. You're still good. You got a little slow run up here. You're still good by 4. Now it's the whole way. Quarter. Clear. Clear. Still clear. Still clear. Little run for you to have. Tie with the inline. Trying to dive in. He's there. He's there. Hanging in there. You're clear. The 33 is about 10 ahead to the top and dropping quick. Holding everybody up. Still good by 2 on Bubba. By 1 Bubba's trying to cross you up here. He's going to shoot mid. 23 shoot mid. You're still just 2 eyes on the outside and you're clear. Tied clear. All good. Higher Bubba. Still clear. And he's right there. Just outside. Just there. Just the fender. Barely there. It's you and him by 5. There's a 41 running a lane up. Little run to you by half. You're still good. I think I wanted to... Check up here. Check up here. Easy right in the middle of the track. If you can here. Talk him in here. Easy. Yep. Come on. Get the right side up. Get the right side tires changed. Start cutting left front. Tie. Leave intact what you can. I don't know if you can cut. Yeah. That's fine. Come on. Confuser flaps up bridge. Clear. Try to leave the hood intact if you can. Hey. Johnny look at me. Saw opening. Bigger opening if you can but leave as much as the fender flange and everything. Yeah. Do whatever you got to do to clear the tire but try to leave as much structure. You know what I mean? We're losing a big chunk of the left front here. Keep the fender flange if you can. If you cut that fender off and there's nothing to attach to you we're screwed. Bridge. Get over the wall. Bridge over the wall. Give me another mechanic over there on the right front please. Go figure out what we got on the right front please. Make sure you don't overheat. See what you got here. I don't know what the fuck we're going to do about this. That thing. Whole thing is killed. We're over here. I know we're taping it up but there's nothing that's going to hold it off the tire. There's no structure there. So either the hood is going to have to come off. Pull the hood off the pins and set it back over the louvers and then fill the gaps. This is the only way that structure is. You know what I mean? We can raise the right front but unpin your hood. Get that tape off and set it back over the louvers and then we'll have to fill the gaps if we can because there's nothing else holding it. BG, start working on some seams with that bare bond. No nails on that. Probably have to clear some more of that left front center when we get over here. We'll do that when we do left side tires. So tie underneath whatever you got. Whatever off you need. We'll try to make some laps here. Get on and get some tape so it don't fly off. We'll have to take it back to the garage. We went on and when we go to the ground and weren't clear you can grab the wheel or just back up straight up to that opening. Wherever NASCAR wants you to go. See you pretty good. Are we going to that opening behind us? Down pit road and go out that stall here if they're okay with it. Two stalls behind us. Please. They've cleared us. Come on back. Come on back. Alright go ahead and cut it here. The truck. Clear to the truck please. Right behind it if you can get it lined up.
