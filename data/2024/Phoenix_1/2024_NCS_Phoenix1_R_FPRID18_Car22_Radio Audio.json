Just fix that zone there and then I think we'll be alright. So just go back to our greens. Just wanting to go with the line. Go for it. Alright, boys. Keep doing what you've been doing on pit road. We're going to use you up today. We'll get our track position, get up there and establish something pretty decent. Try to go for one at the end. And we're ready. Same approach you've had here, guys. Ice is smooth, no mistakes. We'll work our way to the front here, Joe. We know you've got a good car and we'll work on it all day here. So have some fun out there and good luck. Here we go with the greens. Boulman's in line behind you. Remember, don't switch lanes until you pass the start-finish line. It has to be with your back bumper. Soft in front. You're ready?

No yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow. Clear. A little pretty off here, but can't really get a good enough balance rate for you. This is that five, six glass we talked about. High off of two, watch for debris low. It's turning pretty good, so I'm probably going to be late as I go. So if anything, I'm probably going to need to be a little snugger in the opportunity to come. How did you feel like your prior off was compared to guys around you? I just finished the passes to pray off traffic too. Clear Coleman. I haven't said yet. Passes are closed, stay high here off of two. Twenty-two, twenty-one. Twenty-two, twenty-one. Pitcher open, Paul? Out here, staying out. He comes in front of me. Out. Staying out. Seventeen in front, doesn't look like anyone behind yet. Maybe the forty-one's going to be the first one back there. Twenty-first, twenty-first. Coming back to the chews next time. Twenty-first will be row ten. We're twenty now, Coleman, with the seven feet headed. Yep, you're right, thank you. T-twenty, T-twenty, still row ten. T-twenty, row ten. All right, row ten here. Don't hit the box chews at this time. Fifty-four is the leader, going bottom. There's one, two, three bottom, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, bottom. Brad behind you, twenty-one above you. The forty-seven above you, twenty-one behind him. Not going here, lights back on. One to go again. All right, pace cars off here, forty-eight to go in the stage, twenty against the green. Forty-seven above, ten away. Leader is five, four, three, two, one, green. Rolling good, rolling good, quarter in front, quarter in front. All switch before the first finish line. Brad's dropping with you, one outside. Outside bumper, barely. Clear, clear, outside, outside, going to split you now. Middle of three. Outside is clear, outside is clear, you're all clear here. All clear, all clear, all clear. Runs to the bottom by half, half to the bottom. Tight front outside, outside forty-seven. Outside forty-seven, protect down on exit. Brad's got momentum on the bottom, he's lower, still clear lower. Still clear lower inside now, inside, inside one outside. Brad is clear on the bottom, you're clear bottom. It's tight outside of you, mid-three, bad spec inside. Mid-three, mid-three, mid-three, mid-three, mid-three, mid-three, mid-three, mid-three. Still outside, still outside, still outside. Open behind both of them, still outside, still inside. Mid-three here, mid-three, bottom covered by half. Inside is tight, inside is tight, thirty-eight's outside.

Half back on the flat, you'll be top of three if you get there. Top of three, top of three, top of three. Still top of three here, still top of three. Two wide with the forty-seven, two wide with the thirty-eight now, just the thirty-eight. Room in front of the one, still inside quarter, quarter. Open by one behind him, by one behind him, clear down behind him. Still clear by two. Thirty-eight, by three behind. Still hanging bumper, fairly tight, clear. Clear outside bumper here, clear up, clear up, clear up. Eight, you're running on the bottom. Two back bottom lanes, eight, you got a side draft, you're moving. P-twenty right here, P-twenty. Eight, your momentum on the bottom, three-quarter down. Eight, your momentum on the bottom, half to the bottom, three-quarter to the top. Still clear, one to both lanes. Eight's better on the bottom by half. Behind, staying on track behind you. Top of the head by one, you're clear. The eight can send it in there on the bottom. Three-quarter back on the flat, half flat. Clear up here, clear up tight, clear up by half. Half to both lanes, top of the head is clear. No momentum here by two. No pressure. Loosing some time there, initial throttle off at two. Waves loose in the boat. Carrying a lot of speed to the flat. One on the flat, all four down there. One and a half on the flat. Entry rolls his strength. He can put power down by half in line, headlight lower. Headlight down, still clear, head inside, inside. The four is the one behind him. Three-quarter to the four, he's covered at the bottom. Still inside, half to the four. With you inside now, inside four car. Inside tight, inside tight with four. Quarter, bumper, cleared the four. He's got back, in line tight, in line tight. Headlight down, still clear. He's going up the track. Outside of you quarter. Outside bumper, cleared tight, tight, cleared tight. With you dropping, headlight. Half in line. Tight, inside, inside. You're clear right now, he's going to square it up, try to get a run on exit. Still clear. Seventeen's one behind him. Eyes forward here. No one's making much off the bottom yet. Half to the bottom, they can all just carry speed both ends on entry. Tight to you. By himself by one. Half to the seventeen behind him, he's on bottom. Still clear quarter, he's going to get inside on exit. Barely, he's there. He's there, seventeen. Two back to Priest behind him. One to Priest. Half on the bottom, you're clear. Speed higher. One up. They're just killing me. So I can't make it to the two at twelve. Lower, tight inside bumper. Got a bumper on the flat. Still there, still there. Five to seven here behind him. Still there. All alone by five for the forty-eight. Last car that came and got tires, so settle in here now. Tires. No one else is making time behind. Settle in, twenty-seven complete, thirty-three to go. About a half dozen messing around with the PJ one and two, nothing stands out. Twenty-eight, twenty-three's in front. A lot of twenty-eight, ninety's up through the front into the top ten. Baldwin gained a little bit running Peach. Two back, right side's in it with a pull down, lower entry by one. He's running higher, still clear on exit. No gain on this end. Got about four or five more takers in it, one and two now. A little higher entry behind. Laying up by one. He's getting pressured, make sure you get that pull down if you can. No luck with the radius yet. Maintain through one and two. By one, dropping. A twenty-nine and a nineteen, that was a tenth faster than your previous. Bottom lane by half. Still clear down. Twenty-nine by three. Three-quarter on the paint. Half paint, still clear down. Still clear tight. Best guy still running bottom in one and two, but it is an option in dirty air. Twenty-three by half, climbing a lane. Twenty-six to go here. Twenty-two by two, a little closer than he was last lap. Within two, dropping. All the way to the paint. Going to get inside here in the middle corner. Inside bumper, barely. Bumper, barely. Already clear by half and moving. Twenty, same gap as last time, about one and three-quarter. Dropping. Inside sooner now. Inside on the paint. Quarter, still there. Quarter, quarter, bumper. Alright, barely clear. Thirty-six, same gap as last time. Maybe a little closer, one and a half. Dropping. Still clear, he's a little higher this time. Still clear, still clear. Got a bumper cover now. He's inside. Still there, still there. Forty-eight by himself by four. Three to the thirty-eight. Leaders are off-turning too now. Twenty-three to go. By half. Still clear down. Sideways in and off. In and off, destroyed. Thirty-four, ten and a half better than the previous bottom. Seems okay for you. Thirty-four. No pressure behind. Eighteen more here in the stage. Eighteen more. Forty-three. Thirty-seven. By two here. Four guys up front started moving back up to that peach line with a big turn down. That's where Bellini's big chunk's better in here right now is the turn down off of two. Thirty-eight starting to work it behind you. Five-four. Twenty-nine that last lap, chasing thirties. Two laps, thirty-two and a twenty-five in front. Thirty-four. Thirty-one and a thirty in front. Move up into one. Copy, too free to do it. Just so you know, like right now I'd say seventy-five percent of the people are doing it. So just know for the next round once you get tightened up that's where it's going in the long haul. Thirty-eight, thirty-six and a forty-three behind. Twelve more. Twelve, thirty-nine, thirty-six and a forty-three in front. Top ten paces around twenties. Seems like the guys that are running the bottom good here. One and two are having the flat in one and two. So majority are running the top in one and two. The good guys that run the bottom are down on the flat. From about one-third on one-third to two-thirds. No pressure by five, coming at nine to go here at the stage. Fifty-seven, thirty-five and a forty in front. Forty, twenty-five in front. Seven more here, seven. Forty-seven. Moving up for you in one and two. By three behind the hill in here, no momentum, he hit the wall. You're good by four. Fifty. You're good ten and a half, two tenths better doing that one and two. Five to go here at the line, five. Fifty-five, good lap. Four more here, twenty-four. Coleman, I don't know what we're doing different. Like that's as good as guys up in the top ten. I mean, really, he just got to the bottom. If they really say anything else, others dance out. Those are the laps you need to be at to be right on the edge of the top ten. Three to go here, three. Forty-two. Where the heat? He hit the beam just right in front of me to the left. Copy, two more. Thirty-three, two more. One more here, one thirty-nine. Running up in one and two either from lap time standpoint. Talk to us about balance, yellow's out. Just loose, in and off. I fire off, okay, for the first few laps and then the rear just go away. I'm hanging on. Like a, I don't know, three plus, loose, really. I'm going to dump a bunch of air out of the right rear here. If I get the right rear in the track. Yeah, I mean, it's like, it's like, But it's just the detail on the acceleration piece, it's not a chance. Copy. Make sure you get caught up here, make sure you get your brake check in. Paste cars in the middle of one and two. Stop and short here. Copy, stop and short. Stop and short will be clean in. Once you come to your pit stop, it's going to be the nineteen-two openings in you. Stop and short on your side, the fifty-one will be coming around you. Still closed here, red light, still closed. Pits are open here, get another brake check in. The nineteen-two openings in you, stop and short on your side. Going on the three here, going on three. On pit road guys, here we come. Ten away. On three, ready and five, four, three, two, one. One lane here, one lane. Five reds, remember, five reds running low, five reds running low. Still outside quarters. Outside quarters, five reds low. Going back to your greens and lower. Going back to your greens and lower, going back to your greens and lower. Alright, good. Leave it at the bottom there, where you are at. Alright, still got us up there, looks like we're nineteen, is the best I can count here. And there we took off, even if it loses me where I would have stayed at. Right rear was terrible honestly. Yeah, that's surprising. It seems like it's worn out. We see the most worn tire, but we've had way worse at times. Way looser some, so it wasn't as bad as I thought it would look. But I got a big swing there on the right rear and then fuel as well, like we talked about. So, we'll take a big piece out of what we had there. Alright, so we should be choosing next time by where P-19 will be row nine. Row nine. I don't see anything stand out other lanes. Like Brad gained a bunch from the bottom and I see another guy gained a bunch from the top. So, seems like both lanes are usable. P-19, row nine, choosing this time. Row nine, don't hit the box leader, is the eleven going bottom? There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, top. It's going to put Bubba behind you, the eight behind him, a 41 underneath, 31 behind him. Excuse me, it's Bubba behind the 41, Kyle behind you. Pacing cars off. Pretty soft in front of you here. Room in front, 10-8, five, four, three, two, one, three. Room in front by one, room in front by one, still inside, half behind, still inside, start finish. Inside still Bubba tight, inside tight, nothing on your lane, bottom's covered, bottom's covered, nothing on your lane within four. Three to the eight up top, you're top of three, top of three. Top of three, almost top of four, top of four, three wide, three wide, three wide, three wide. Top of three, two below, two below, two below, two below here, two below. Top of three, tight, top of three, Bubba's tight, inside barely on the bumper cover. One inside, two lanes below, middle lane is tight cleared. The four is there, bumper, inside the four, just the four, outside, inside, priest, inside priest, Bubba to you, Bubba to you. Inside still, inside, I'll check your left front, inside still, Bubba's trying to get outside of you, your inside top is clear, top is clear, top is clear, just the four. Bubba's tight to you, bottom is clear, clear, clear, clear, sending it in there, half back both lanes behind, bottom's ahead. Top is clear, tight right here on exit, all clear, all clear, all clear, all clear. By half, Bubba is clear on the second lane, he's dropping, he's going to see an inside here, inside, inside quarter, inside quarter, inside still, inside, one back to the four, he's going on the apron behind, by half, half on the apron, clear down, clear, clear. You have the four going higher, three quarter back higher, all clear here on exit, all clear, bottom's ahead. Half back, half back, 42 off the bottom, by one, side by side behind. Clear on exit here by half, by half, 42's going to get cleared here at the dog leg, three quarter in line, it's John Hunter, he is clear, three quarter he is clear. Headlight higher, lane higher, outside, outside at the peach, tight, with you, dropping, inside, 42 by himself, by himself by half, half to the 31 behind him, still outside, still there, just the one, too wide, too wide, middle lane is still there, middle lane's clear, just the 42 on the bottom, just the 42, one is a headlight lower by half, just the 42, headlight lower by half, all right, you got the 42, Ross got it covered here, you may try to go three wide, you're top of three, top of three, middle's clear, just Ross on the bottom, middle's clear, just Ross on the bottom, just the one, after the 42 who's higher, you're still clear up, still clear up, after the 42 who's higher, headlight up outside, outside 42, outside, outside, still there, by four behind, by four behind him, still there, still by four, racing behind him, P-21 here, four back to the four, single file, no pressure behind, fight the same thing, this is better, but it still fights the same thing, copy, copy, fight the same thing, five to the four, then five to Larson, 93, 01 and then 95 in front, only one making time behind Larson, 04, 02 in front, three back paint, you can't be about a car length higher to the center, by two to Larson, it's about even from your previous lap into three, maybe a half car length behind into three that time, but you can't be higher, one third to center, it's two back to Larson, six to the four, two back, one back, half lower, still clear, half on the flat, gonna get inside on exit, inside the five all by himself, all alone here by six, four to the four, same length, 20, 80s and 90s up there in front of Larson, by two and dropping, can't roll any later on the car, more trying to roll the speed in, just keep getting loose, got it, six to LaJoy, 03, 40 in front, 90s in front of that, 99, not really losing anything into three, a little bit off of four, most of it just into one, a little bit off of two as well, maintaining your gap behind, 17, 09 in front, 20, starting to get to the thing where the leaders are starting to split, running up and down at one and two, first two ran up that time, the majority of the top seven ran down, lean for it, by two, equal momentum, slightly to him, mid-lane, lane higher by half, still clear, tight, he's gonna roll it, still clear, third line, then by seven, see you, one and a quarter moving, 37, 17s in front, by two, serious speed tracking with you, a little lower now, no pressure off the flat, 16, 18 in front, bigger gap by two and a quarter, 17, majority of the top 15s are at flat, 23, 40, kind of maintained through three and four last time from your previous lap, no pressure behind, that's a better one and two, whatever you did is different, 22, it's probably no better being up than three and four, looks like bottom, but your one and two is for sure better last lap, LaJoy searching behind you, 26, half, come up here, see on the limiters, it all gets going, limiters, it all gets going, copy, half in line, half in line climbing, so half up, half up, gonna try to roll it, clear, tight, clear, he ran up a lane last time down here, still clear, clear, half back, three quarter, a little bigger gap this time by one, about the 29, nowhere, some speed, three by three quarter, still clear, pull down, into the paint, still clear low, still clear tight, gonna get a bumper cover, you're clear, clear, 26, 25, last time he's inside on the paint, inside down there, pull inside, still there, quarter, bumper, clear, gap is last time, one and a half, open up the seal, by one, dropping, all the way to the paint, still clear on the paint, 30, same speed in front, still got some flats and teens up front, top ten, LaJoy's making it inside on the paint, inside barely, already cleared him, now leader's off at two, just getting in traffic, four, Jason, 33, half on the bottom, clear tight, got a bumper barely, clear, clear, still expect them to split here soon, a little better than what your previous has been, got a car length better, running the bottom at one and two, still clear by three quarter, got it, 44, by one and a quarter, still clear here, won't hit Tito, keep in your marks here for a few more, keep digging, by two, moment of view, 36, Jason, a 30, a little closer this time, by one and three quarter, inside, inside paint, bumper, bumper covered, you're going to clear him quick, already clear, already clear, by two, by two and a quarter, no pressure, two, get your page and brakes here, page and brakes down the front, by two, this is time, pit pit pit, pit pit pit, pit pit, by one, here we come guys, around the corner, ready and now, on your mark, going on the three, on the three, turn away boys, ready and five, four, three, two, one, hold, all the way up reds, now, going back to your reds, now decal, going to your greens, now, greens, greens, all the way to the yellow line, three, two, one, go, got one outside the eight, after the eight you're clear up, clear up, clear up, LeJoy's by four off pit road with you, he is clear, three back, still outside the eight, by two to LeJoy, still there with the eight, quarter, clear on exit, clear up, clear up, got a buffer between you and LeJoy, now the eleven is a leader, trying to find him on track, behind you, you're good, sixty-six to go in the stage, sixty-six to go in the stage, thirty-eight is a leader up there in the second car in front of you to un-lap yourself, up in front of Preece is a leader, the leader right here to un-lap yourself, still entry to one, you're losing your time here on the fire off, clear, next four is four in position here, all these guys in front are in position now, forty-five chasing a forty and a fifty, sixty-three to go once it cycles in leaders the eleven into turn three now, there's only like seven cars between you and some of them still have to pit, maximize your lap time here, fifty-five a thirty-three and a fifty-five in front, center to center to fire off, I'm paying it off, safe, your three and four is pretty good, still just like right there off the wall to the landing in one, still a little bit off the two, your three and four is not bad, fifty chasing forty, seventy is in front of that in the group that's mild up here, stopped in traffic, twenty-eight fifties right now but he's in traffic, one and two is a lot better last time, sixty, same in front, there's some eighties in front of that, on the right rear limiter a little bit here to fire off, fifty-seven, that's not a bad one, the last two laps still a little bit of roll speed into one, that was a lot closer even more that lap, he gave some back off of two though, no pressure behind, everyone but the three up here in four positions, if you are any bit tighter you can use the apron there, one third across the center, one and two, eighty-three chasing ninety, good guys can just stay on it past the two thirds, yellow three here's the lapper, three is pitting in front of you, the three is pitting in front of you, ninety-eight, ninety-one and eighty in front, back to your rhythm, fifty-five to go, ninety, seventy-five in front, four eighty-six in front, you're exactly straight away in front of the leaders, fifty-two to go, fifty-four same in front, three ninety-five in front, high eighties in front of that, doesn't make it time behind you, six oh five in front of you, seven chasing flat, you're not losing any speed, get to the bottom of three to the leader, that's pretty similar, ninety-two off of four and into one, ninety-four is not bad, ten oh two in front, ninety-seven in front of that, one and two from the previous lap, twelve twenty-three in front, touch worse than one and two that lap, majority are still running bottom into one and two, eighteen ninety-seven is flat in front, that's better, close as you've been, two nine, oh six and a fifteen in front, big chunk of time with throttle off of four, closer on that end, better off of four oh one chasing a ten, best entry to center you've had down there, one and two right there, just like that every time, flat chasing an eleven, just can't replicate it and don't look like, nine chasing eighteen, that's it again, one and two right there, two of the last three have been solid, no pressure behind, not making time, still got three quarters of a straightaway in the leader, forty to go, three chasing twenties and thirties, the ohs are pretty good, ten chasing twenty-eight, one that stood out right there in one and two, that was good, flat, good lap, chasing thirty-seven, so the PJ line is serviceable for dirty air in one and two, twenty-seven chasing twenty-one and thirty, thirty-seven to go, thirty-seven, ten chasing twenty, not a terrible lap, five chasing twenty, leader start finish, now twenty-nine chasing thirty-five, better one and two, twelve chasing twenties, thirty-three to go, leader start finish, now twenty-one, same in front, leader is better on the bottom, everybody has been messing around with the PJ as I said, he approaches traffic here, you keep in your marks, try to get these two in front of you, you're a bit better, forty-three chasing the same, seven just come out on tires behind you there, seven back, was a wash in one and two, maybe a little better, slightly better one and two, fifty in front, you're slightly worse, entering higher, grabbing the peach, goodbye one to tires here, half back tires, inside forty-seven, not for position he has tires, the joys close back in with it, six, then it's about thirty back to the leader behind that, twenty-eight to go, seems like we're consistently better on the bottom in one and two, maintaining your dampest six here, thirty-eight, fifty-eight to sixty-four in front, that's better in one and two than when you were running the top, thirty chasing fifty, so you're best not to get held up here, catching the flow, fifty, any gap that you can do is helpful, twenty-five to go for the leader, twenty-three, right car's been staying higher here, he's a slower, no pressure behind, five to LaJoy, then about twenty-five to the leader Redick, fifty-seven to a fifty, forward to LaJoy, forward to LaJoy, just a lapper, work him quick here, don't let him do what he did to Preece, still there, door, quarter, bumper, clear, clear, clear, half higher, half higher, still clear, still clear, back at your rhythm, leader's only about fifteen back, coming to twenty-two to go, we are better on the bottom in one and two, no pressure, so by fifteen the leader with a car crushes, Reda LaJoy, leader's tight to him, he gets nineteen to go at the line behind you, two then a half, one hires LaJoy, still clear up, key is clear, two back, key is clear, forty-five got inside of him, alright, there's single file by three, Hickor Marks, thirty-eight, thirty-three in front by three, leader's on the bottom, there's single file now, leader's going to have to run the bottom, five back, five back, alright Reddick's probably going to get clear here in the one, he's on the bottom lane about seven back, seventeen to go, Reddick cleared up, washed up in front of him at the two-thirds, you're good by six to the leader, sixteen to go for him here at the line, four hits high, no gain right there, no gain, see a gain here on the straightaway, high entry with a radius by three, lane up, three, not a big gain for him at three and four, still by three, lane higher by two, two, radius, one and a half radius, back to fourteen to go, T-two's about nine behind him, no gain by two, two, run's going to carry here in the one though, we'll get within two, within two, one and a half, two to the twenty, one up, run on a radius, three-quarter up by one, one, one and a half, two to the joy, two to the twenty, by one, dropping, half lower, still clear, half lower, still clear, inside now, inside, barely clear, clear, he's got thirteen to go by one, one, dropping, half lower, half lower, going to get a bumper cover, he's showing it tight, it's tight, it's tight, inside, inside, T-two is about three behind him here on the apron, still there, quarter bumper, clear, clear, twelve to go,

two, slow car is going to stay high up here, the yellow and black one, again, eleven more, going to get within about one and a quarter here, one and climbing, twenty got inside of him, one to the bottom, half bottom, they're boxed in racing by three, lapper is going to stay high, two and a half to redick, who's clear, both of them that's going to be playing with here, still outside, still

keep flipping it here, three more, go up here and try to get this forty-one, two to go at the line, two more, one more, one, no pressure behind, three checkered right here at the line, I just, I mean, I can't get in or off, I can't move around, I got no reward, I can't get in or off, but then I get tight so I can't follow them, but I don't have enough good in and off to get in a different lane and make a run. Was that any better at all? No, it was identical, it didn't make a difference. Make it worse? I mean, I was, I don't know if we made it worse, I mean, I was definitely tighter in the center, but the in and off was no better at all, identical, before a change, but you got it. What do you got? I was going to tighten it up some more, but if you're saying it's not doing anything or just tightening the center up, we're not going to help ourselves, right? We've done the air pressure, dual wedge, we've kind of touched all the knobs, that's a debate you're all committed to do. Yeah, it just doesn't seem like we've touched the in and off at all, it's identical from the start of it. I mean, your times here for the first 50 laps were definitely more competitive to the field, I don't know, you know, where we were gaining that time, but it felt the same, but it seemed like we were a little more competitive. Better air, did copy some workplaces. I mean, possibly it got a little better, but I mean, small, small. Pits are open to the leaders, we'll be second time by. We'll pit this time, stopping short on your side, 51 will be coming around. Make sure you get a brake check in. One guys, here we come. You want a pit, right Paul? I guess I never asked.

One lap, I don't want those guys to stay out and we're lining up behind them, right? Yeah, you're right. Alright, give up four spots or so, three or four spots. Give up that and the track position in between it. Alright, just start dropping down here, got a couple lead lab cars that's got to pass you. Five ninety-nine, forty-one, thirty-eight, seventy-seven. They're working their way up now, they're coming up the bottom for some reason, watch your apron. Don't let any of these guys jump, you have the four forty-two, that's who you're racing.
