{"text": " Alright, fire in the hole. Frankie, you got me on two? You guys got me on channel one on the box here? Yup, now that's clear buddy. You good? Squint? You hear me? Squint? You good? He might be in the middle of something down there. Sample? On channel one? For what it's worth, I feel like wind has picked up quite a bit. We didn't talk about it earlier, but definitely picked up up here. Blowing from turn two to turn three direction. Sample buddy. You guys got me on channel one here? Squint? You hear me? Nah, I had to pull out some planes around here, but all good now. Take car, start the roll. You got me on channel two. Look to your right here, Squint. Let me know when you see the two cars. Nah, I got to run out of style before I can get up there. I'll take him to five away. Five away mark would be the three box, so... Yeah, that should be good, because right after that I can pick him up pretty well. So I'll take you ten away, then five away on pit road, just to help Squint out, then he'll call you in and out of the box. So far. So looking at your camera here. That's even. I'm going to lose you before I can call it too close from the twelve right here, so we'll try it next time. That's fine, I can go four. You can start working as soon as you enter three. Right here, you're clear. Now he's outside, door. Quarter bumper clear. Clear. That's an easy clear right there, that's a half. Okay, that's all. I think I got it. Like I said, my camera, like a quarter of, when I'm half a car clear, a quarter of his hood is still, you know, outside of my camera. It's kind of like a difficult perspective there, so just do your thing. I really don't want to go with you there. Simple. I just know that on XZ of two it's going to be a little bit tight, you know, like you're going to call it, well not tight actually, like a little bit conservative. I'll make those calls and everywhere else I go on you. Yep, sounds good. Let's run pit road this time. Don't swerve into your box or anything. Don't cut the corner. You know, give us a false reading here. Just run it like it would be serving a normal pester. Start with all red here. Try to stay consistent with my count here to your seven blues. Start in three, two, one, here. That's ten away here. Five away here. Five away here. Back to your reds. Five, four, three, two, one. White from here. Two whites. Two, one, Frankie. The boxes are so big that the ten away only confuses me and kind of like makes me start looking for my box. And the ten away is still like super, super, you know, long time before I have to turn in. So let's get rid of the ten away and just go straight to the five away. Yep, we can do that. That's like when it's quick. That's quick. Alright, we're all good on what you ran there. You were a 48.2 on your last segment there. Okay. Coming back to the green here. It'll be the 12 out back as a five. Stay above the yellow line. Square it up with the car in front of you until start finish. I'll call the line every time. I won't give you a countdown. I'll just say line so that way you know when you hear it. Good luck, man. Grab your belts one more time. Switches where you need them. Have a good day here. Oh boy. Stop, stop, stop. Ten away. Five. In the box. Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, green. Line. Just one outside. Just one outside. Just one outside. Still just one outside here. 17. One and a half lanes off of you. One outside. That's your right rear. Take it if you have it. Be two out if you get there. Kind of staggered. Almost three out here. Back to two out. Back to one. One out. One out. One out. Clear everything. You cleared it all. You cleared it all. They did not cut from the top lane. Only behind you. All clear. Half to both lanes here. Thirty-four tighter to you here. Good with a run outside here. Outside only. Outside. Make sure you keep this five clear up for a second here. Twenty's going to have a run to your right rear outside. Five tight bumper. No tight bumper. Still outside. Five cutting near inside. Clear behind twenty. Inside only five. Two back behind. Now just five inside. No push either lane. It's pretty wide in here. Still just a five. Remember if they stack up that second lane will work. Inside just a twenty. The five's going to cut. They did not cut. Just one inside. Twenty cut a little. Back to kind of staggered. Two inside. You cleared the twenty. One in. Five car only inside here. Still five car only. Barely five car. Back to your door now. Twenty's going to be your push. Still inside five. Still inside. Still inside. Still in there diving. Still inside. Half lane off cutting. He's cutting. You can take whatever you need. He's a full cut by himself by two here. Two back two wide. It's going to be your moment up here if you stall him out. No pressure. I'll back you to your lane. Still inside. Clear to chase if you want. Clear by three here to the twelve. Go take a spot back here. Still inside here. Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow. See the image here guys. Just so you know. That's it. Your balance there. No. There will be two's and then three. An exit. Shut in the front. Observe the center of three and four. Beautiful. Copy. Kind of a way to stay here. Stay out here about five laps under tires here. Copy. I'm waiting for the lineup I've asked. I think he was just announced I guess. They might give it to us. Close. Time squid. Staying out right? Yes. Confirmed. Staying out. Staying out here. Staying out. You're correct where you're at. Behind the five. So good. So for the time being we should have an opening now. The two was collected in that and there's at least one lap down here. Do you think it's top or bottom here on your favorite? I think either one will work. Probably top can be a little bit better. But honestly I don't think there is a big advantage. This is why the bottom is better on the start. We're going to come choose. Let's choose number six here. Okay. Man, somebody fucking keep it ready for a full lap. What the fuck is that? Check that out. We heard it was on both channels so we don't know. We're working on it. But we heard it on channel one and channel two. We have to figure that shit out. They're not going this time. One more lap here. They've got to pick up the two cars so the two is out. One. Breaking radio check. Channels two. We're hearing it on both channels as well. Clear ahead here. Got about 45 seconds to the green. So we should get it all off. They're going to figure it out down there. So 20 car out back. Model will be 12 and 42. Everybody gets aggressive on the cut so don't worry about so much of that. Exit at two here. That's going to be your advantage. Lap 12 here. Still going to lap 60. We'll leave you this time. So pace will be different coming to the box for 10 away. Five, two, one. Be ready. Green. And line. You're clear to cut. Clear to cut. 42 will be half back. We'll be inside by entry. One inside here. 20 still in line with you. Two inside here. 12 then 42. 42 is going to have no mo. Just the 12. You're held at 20. Still inside 12. Still there. Still there. 12. Left your quarter and outdoor. Not cutting. Did not cut. Held you up. So just the 12 down there. Tight on you. So just the 12. 20 trying to peak middle here. Still clear. 12 went way down low. 20 tight left rear. Inside just the 12 still. Still 12 inside. Still in there. Not cutting. Not cutting. Cut a little. He cut. Still in there. Just your hand free back behind. Still one and a half lanes lower here. Just the 12. No push either lane behind. Still 12 even. Still just the 12. Did not cut. And one moment with you this time. Still in there. Pulling you back now. Still inside. Door. Still inside. Even tight. We're on coming 42. Going to be inside. 12 cut. 42 cut. Inside left rear now. Get ready. Good momentum if they get stacked up. He's got a little tight. Still inside though. Still inside. Clear. You can take whatever you need. 42 not cutting. Not cutting. State on track. Still inside one. Just the one inside. Still just one car inside here. 20 keeps peaking at the middle. Can't make it there. Still just the 42 inside. If the 10 shuts this door the second lane is going to open up. Still inside 42. Tight door. Clear. Give me a big crossover. Get both of these off of 2. One back half higher. One higher half back. Still clear. Clear. He has no mow. He attacked entry. You gain 2. And then he's going to take the 2. That's going to be a good one. And he's going to take the 2. Half back. Still clear. Clear. He has no mow. He attacked entry. You gain 2.5 on exit though. We're back to 42 to go. 4-0. Working one lane lower here. Half back still. Inside bumper. Inside door. Momentum with you on exit though. You're clear. You're stalling him out good. He's about a foot on the apron. Just trying to get any kind of air. But you're stalling him out well. It's worth saying that just so the war room can look at it. But the A cars come from the back pretty quick. I don't know if he's doing something different. Two-four half. Pity to put tires on and that's just enough difference. But just worth a note. As expected everybody's stuck right here. Six to the left. Pressure tires on A. 20. Starter attack. Entering at 3 compared to you. He's getting some pressure from the six behind. Lane higher here. Still two back. He lost a nose by three. All clear. Comes to a run though. Starter build a decent run. Still half in line. Same thing. He went to run that second, third lane right here. Still clear by three plus. It's going to be really tight because this is close to his vendor car. So take advantage off of two. Still clear by three. Six has definitely got a little better pace in the 20. Just cleared a four back. The six is making about a half a lane lower. Work through one and two. Just everybody looking for clean air. A half car wider than you entered turn three last time. It definitely has widened out. Inside bumper clear. That's something. They're just able to carry a little more speed to the center I think. But still good. It's going to be close. The six will beat you here. Still by a half. All good. Half lane lower. He stalled him out pretty good by two. Still half to one lane lower though on exit right here. Okay. What are we going to do right now? Cover it. Copy. Going to the stage. He just tried the top at one and two to build runs. One back to the bottom. Half. Still clear. He ran all the way back to his normal line. Plus three here on exits. Good exits. The top at one and two. Whatever he's battling balance wise gets a better run. Just kind of put the bandaid on it. Good thing. Still clear here. He's just running way down low. Keep those good exits up till he never passes you. Gear bumper half lane lower. One lane lower. He's going to have company for the 20 though. He's going to have to play a little bit of defense. All clear here. That's 77. He's going to back those three guys up to you. Come on. Let's go get in the 10th meter here. Let's get a couple spots before the end of the stage. Diving inside bumper here. You'll be clear on exit. Good work right there. He's going to play a lot of defense on the 20 now. Coming back to 10 more. End of going to stage. 77 dropping hard here. He's going down in line with the 77. You're still clear. Clear. Clear. Out of line but clear. Half a lane lower here. Inside down. Inside even. You see him. Just shooting him here too. Back to the six. Not cutting. Did not cut. Two back to the six here. All clear to big cross if you need it. Still all clear on your right rear here. Half back. All clear. Clear. Clear. Run coming. Out of line inside. He cut. Just barely cut but the inside. Inside even. Just doing the six here. Three back to the 17 behind. Keep fighting here. Five to go. Four to go. Still there. He cut. Just a half cut from him. Still inside. Still there. Clear. Clear. Clear. Clear. Clear. Inside now. Still inside. Not cutting. Still inside here. So just shooting him. It's two back to his teammates. Nothing behind that. Two to go at the line. Inside. Inside even. 17. Still inside here. Still inside. One more here at the line. Still inside even. 17. Still just shooting the 17 right here. Still in there. Still inside bumper. Door. Still in there. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Three back to your rear. One's there. Troubled. Disconnected man. The back of the car is loose on entry. Side to center. Passing center. And then loose on exit. It's very similar to the side run. Just over the grid. Super greasy. Very very limited on the stuff I can do. My brakes are two rounds to the front already. 10-4. So you think the entry causes the center tightness? No. No. It's the separation. 99.7. Alright. We'll do four tires here. The two's out of the race so if you have an opening now, you'll be coming around to 14. We'll work out a little air pressure for you here to start. 27 of your road. Before you. Like your seven away mark. Road is still closed here. Make sure your stuff's cleaned up here so you can stop the box good. All the guys in the top five are working pretty hard right now. 10-4. Time. Make sure your fans are off for the stop here. Make sure your fans are off too as well please. I never turn them on. I don't know if you guys want me to but the barrel was mine. You're all red. We'll stack here. You're all red when you get to the barrels. Seven blues. Three, two, one. Five away. Five, four, three, two, one. Four tires going on the jack here. Bird coming. Squid. One line. Could be one line, one line, one line, one line. Outside of you, outside of you. Red, red, red, white here. Anything I can do better out there to help you guys? We'll take a look in here. Think about your top lane restart there. Any better than the bottom? We'll restart P15 here. P15? Um, I think we can start. I'll take the bottom. Then your number will be eight. Let's keep an eye on it to see how it develops. You know? I'm trying to judge who's around you, who's going to be more aggressive, all that. I feel like you're going to be choosing behind the 19 here, most likely. But, yep, we'll see. Your number's eight here, coming to choose. You like the top better or what? I'm indecided. I feel like the last one, they said data is top better. We're at seven. We're at three. Four, five, six, seven. Take the top no matter what. Come to the green here, make sure your stuff's right. Switch is right here. Over 100 laps in this stage. Run should be about the same length as stage one before pitting. So, we are 10 away now. Five, two, one, green. Line, they cut inside of you. Everybody cut here. Still clear high if you need it. Still clear behind 19 here. 48, one lane up. 48, one lane up, one back. It's going to be two in, one out if you make it here. Still clear behind 19. Clear inside. Clear inside 48, looking here. Still inside 34. Partial cut. Still inside 34. No pressure behind him. Good momentum here off of two. Net this positive. All clear here. Clear across if you need it. Still clear across if you need it. Still clear across whatever you need here. Bottom lane is a little stacked right here. Still clear. Yep, you'll connect that. Yep, you're good. Inside's full now. 48 coming with the push. Still inside 34. Still inside 34. He's getting pulled back by the 48. You're clear. Quick if you want it. Now inside the 20. Two lanes down here. That'll be middle if you make it to the 14. Just inside 20. Just inside 20 here. Still there. Still there. Still there. Clear. Clear if you need your momentum. 34 cutting. Will be inside. Just one inside 48 trying to force the middle. Not there. Inside under the yellow line right now. Still inside under the yellow line. Way down, Mo. We'll have no Mo. Still inside. Still inside. Still inside under the yellow line right now. Still inside under the yellow line. Way down, Mo. We'll have no Mo. 48 closer here. You're clear. Still no run out back to the 48. Good momentum off of 2 here. Still down there. Door momentum with you. Back to even tight. Really tight. He got tight. You're gonna be clear. He tried to cut to get back to you here. Still in tight barely. Bumper. Bumper one lane lower. Still bumper momentum back to you here. Gonna be clear. Alright. All clear. Good job. Good restart here. You and the 14 are stretching everything out back. Stay aggressive going forward here. The 43 faded at the end of the run. Right. Back of the car. Copy that. Copy that. It's a little more of an almost disconnected. Like it's a little more of a track but also the front is not that great. We're fighting off pretty good on the restart. But then I just stopped. 10-4 copy. Seeing if we can do anything different. I mean it looks like he's just kind of searching for grip right here. Yeah the 20 is a little more patient than throttle. But when he hits his lap it looks line for line with the 11. The point of the run where the line just started going away in the front as well. Copy that. 14 starting to surge because the 48 is searching behind him right here. Still no pressure really. We're still at least 30 away from anybody really shorting this. They're actually running the second lane down here in 3 and 4 in clean air. When you're looking for clean air don't be scared. Right side's on that second seam either. They've cleaned it up. 3 or 4? Yeah correct. Like there's guys that are splitting the second seam down with the middle of the car. Not really for speed just for clean air. They're just trying to search for a little bit more clean air. That's as high as anyone's got right there. You just have to be the judge of it. You're still driving away from the 14. 12 minutes by there. Yep you're left. 3 and 4 looks really good. Copy that. Is it you can't put the power down or you can't change direction? 12. Made a comment that the 20 car that uses partial throttle longer does not get the wide open until the latest out of anybody. I know he's only running like T7 but that's a comment from the war room. Another balance update. On the front stretch here. Give us another balance update. The only thing that's going to catch you out back right now is the 48. It's a pretty good run. The distance on him with that 1 and 2 there. We're going to have 1.10 here. Still probably 10 to 15 away from the first people shorting. Last couple laps were pretty good there. Last couple laps same speed as the leader. So whatever you found keep going here. Still searching at 1 and 2 trying to find something. He's doing a really high early entry right now. 5 and 24 coming here too. Really? 5 also. Here comes 19, 20. 10-4 give us a couple more here. Really really short pitting here. 10-4. 10-4. 10-4 give us a couple more here. Really really short pitting here. So we're going to like to run 1 or 2 more at least. Everybody's pitting in front of us now. 10-4. 10-4. Alright break bias here. I have one blending off the pit road. You see him to the left. Still there. If you can make it if not run another. I see you. You're clear across here. All red. Doing out speed. All red. All red. Increasing to 7 blue. 3, 2, 1. The 45 leaving here. We are 508. Behind the 45. Behind the 45. 1, 4 tires going on the jack. 11 squid. Tell him red. Right outside. One light outside. 11 outside. White. White. Two light. Big. Going to have the last one coming by you. The 54 you can go here. Clear. 3-4. A lot better tires than the 54 here. Everything behind you. You jump the 43 in them. Going to take a good lap to get pressures up here. It'll come to you. 54 and 48 are going to be the tail end of stage points. Going to have a couple lap pressure tires in them. Clear. It's better than those guys up there. Really loose in squid. It feels like it's dancing the whole time. The cork stopping. He can hold his brake a little longer. And move his apex early around the cork. Just a reminder on all your braking techniques. Holding it a little bit longer. All that stuff. Just keep working here. Lap 130. 55 to go. Last lap was the second fastest on track. So really good lap. 50 to go on the stage. Still got a long way. It's about the same run that you started the stage with now. Do you think the fans would help his balance shift at all? The fans might be a foot-speed, but they're going to be a little bit more aggressive. So, balance here. I hope you think it's worth something trying. Or not. Don't be looking at that camera right here. Go get the 54th camera. Come on. You're driving away from everything else. 17 just matching lap times. He's starting to get pressure from the 77 who's on better tires a lap down. You're all going to be catching a couple guys that have not pitted as well up here. Don't finish the turn. Between 34 we just slide off the line too much now. They're probably capping. I don't know if that's just him running too much pace or if it's an adjustment or what. But it seems like it's like practice. I think it's slowing or early there. 77 trying to cut here. Outside still. Inside as well. You're high inside. Probably 20 plus lap newer tires here. Don't forget about your earlier mid-speed into three here. Keep that decent wrap up off of four. I know you're fighting it. Plus two car lengths on exit to him. You're going to have to tell me if it's better or it looks better. Seven on old tires here. 17 coming with a small run here out of line. Clear inside now. Clear behind 17 here. Still in there even. Door even. Still even here. Still even. That's the middle if you make it. Clear both lanes now. Still outside here. He's going to race you. Still outside. 31 but tires going to be inside. That's a lot of help there. Inside here. Still inside here. 31. Middle clear high. Still inside here. 31 is on. 15 laps. At least newer tires. You're all clear behind. All right. Come on. We've got to keep after here. 33 more laps. Three car laps. Going to at least get to the 54 here. Got to keep that 43 back there. He's catching the three car. Does have tires but a lot of front end damage up here. He has been running the top both ends. I don't think you'll get to him off of two yet. Quarter bumper clear. Clear. Clear. Clear. Door quarter bumper clear. He'll be tight in line with you here. Tight rear bumper. You're driving now by half good. Still clear by three here. By three. By three. All good here. All right. Drive away here. T12 right here. Stage points at the 17. A lot of company for the 38. Just come off pit road with tires. Four tires now in your mirror. Should stall them out for just a little bit. Make sure it doesn't cost you time. Still clear here. Still clear. Run coming. No. Still clear. Still clear. But he's going to probably get you to just set sail. Just make sure you're good on whatever he does. Clear on exit here. Come on. You're running that 48 down. It's right here. The 38er dropped away by ten on the 54. So still getting away from him. Quarter bumper clear. Clear. Tight rear bumper here. In line though. Coming back to 15 more. 15 to go on the stage. T12 still. The 58 is the effect. T12 is so much better than me. Exit at one. I feel like he said he's really loose on the extremities. Like entry, exit. I feel like that's what he said. We're going to work on entry. We think we can't produce. But just go worry about that 48. We'll talk about it at the stage race. He saw the one save. Saw it there. Just you and him here. No pressure either laying behind. You and him even. You know he's going to race you overly hard. Clear to the third lane. Clear all the way by three by three. Good exit. He made a big diamond here. He's coming back to your inside. Just you and him here. Coming back to five more. Did not cut. Still inside tight left rear. Tight door. You and him here. Still nothing coming out back yet. Still inside door. Quarter. Quarter. He got really free. Clear. Two to go. Come on. Got to run two hard ones here. He's going to keep after it. One more. Going to have to basically run all the way back to the start finish line here. Yellow here. Yellow. Yellow. He was all yours. Quit. Talk to me about what you got there. You got a free pass? Sounds like shit. The car fly up tighter than before. I just have to wait longer for the run and then eventually, eventually I get free on entry and exit. Both dive center, passing center. I'm two and a half rounds on brakes on the front. You're happy? It'll be four tires going on the jack here. Should be open and in and out. Road opens. Four tires going on the jack. You will not have to come around the 14 this time. I don't know what's happening with your right hand but it sounds like shit. Cranking. When the road opens, it'll be four tires going on the jack. It's not open. Copy. Everything I say, that's good. Yeah, I got you. Still got me on two franking. Yep, I got you. The position is 17. That's the gap you're going to have to close. Once they open pit road, it's still closed here. What, he's not on pit road? We'll find out exactly what box number. He's not, he's going to be before you. The first box onto pit road. Pit road will be open this time. You're all ready when you get there. It'll be the first box in. The six will be about your six away mark. Seven blue, three, two, one. Last one you'll pass around is the 45. You are five away. Five, four, three, two, one. Four tires going on the jack. The one, easy clear behind the one. One light, one light, one light, behind the one, behind the one. You'll have to push your lights. Don't push them, don't push them. It was a little bit long, but there is anything I can do to help the left run. Let me review it. The only thing I know so far is car placement, but let me review when I get the video here. For some reason it was more slick than the previous time. I don't know, the box is getting rubber or what. I feel like I can lock my tires way easier. Copy, we'll take a look at that too. Rubber, and you guys can scrape the rubber out. That would be nice. Should be coming back to choose here. I think we favor the top because it was a good start last time. I think your number should be six here. Here it is, taking the bottom. That's one, two, three, four, four, five, six. Take the top. Outback is 54, has really good short run speed, has been struggling in traffic. The one has struggled on short run speed as well. His restarts have kind of been all over the place. That should be our places to try to take advantage of that. Make sure all your stuff is right, switches right here. Still got 120 to go. Nice and tidy here. Hand line to start finish. Ten away here. Five away, two, one, be ready, waiting, waiting, green. Rolling and rolling, tight front, hand line to start finish, really tight front. Tight front at the line now, cut to the middle until you have it. They all went under you here. Going to be at least two to three inside, three inside, four inside. Three to four inside here. Three to four inside. Still three to four inside. Still at least three to four inside here. Two inside now, two in, two in. Two in here, two in, two in. They all cut. Kind of staggered two in. Still two, one in, one in now. One in, very bottom, 34 trying to peak middle here. Still one inside, way down low. Still one inside, the 34. Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow behind you. This is the achievement. They just back off right in the wrong spot and now we're just seeing dark right there. 34, copy. All of the guys just tight. Keeping those in when it opens. Mid-99. Road's still closed here, still closed. Behind us we're thinking about peak here when it opens and do a kind of a little adjustment for you. Okay. Delay there. We would only lose three to four spots if we did, so we're thinking about making an adjustment, firing some tires on it. We've got plenty of sets. We're used to right there, squeeze, but honestly, don't throw us that feedback too much because I wasn't in the clear shit. I wasn't in the four wide stop. Yeah, for sure. I'm thinking that there might be a little benefit to the two to three laps on your tires, though. Sam, four. Right here. Let's go. All red. All red. Yeah, right there. Not worth the penalty here being smart. Only racing the five off your road, so let's be smart on your lights here. Up to your blues. Three, two, one. Five away. Four, three, two, one. Four tires going on the jack here. All the way to the wall, all the way to the wall. Off your reds here, off your reds. Not racing anybody? Single file before you get by the safety trucks here and stuff? I squeezed the tape on my box. They're one nice and strong. Is that fresh? I don't know if I got to her on that one, but I'll have them cleared up there. Those parts there, the wheel track marks are chewed up. I need that because that's my complete or my reference, like this. The previous to this one I definitely was wrong, but this one I couldn't see the light. So I need some more help there. Remember that that's my sign. So I need that to be nice and clean. Turn four. I'll have them clean up the corners there. We'll leave you in the five in front of the 22 here. Your numbers should be nine here. I think we need to favor the top, not give up a row though. All the way in front of the 22 here. Yeah, number will be nine. The eight is from that initial caution, started the race from like 30th, and he drove all the way to like 16th. So with just five laps, they'll retire. So definitely going to be a positive here. Turn four. Top right. I know it didn't work, but still the right way. Yeah, I think that's the right move. Gives you options. Your number is nine here. I'll let you know when we get to five. Five, six, seven, seven, eight, nine, and five. Yep, six, seven, eight, nine, and five. That's fine. Yep, take that. I should have called it to you quicker when you were at the line to chase the middle, but the 54 may have been there already too. But we'll get him this time. He was already there. I mean the whole restart, it was a cheat show. I mean we were not in the South Phoenix line and I was already all jacked up with everyone. So good. Good, and this one. Rears are ready here. Switches right. Ten away here. Five away, two on green. Line, good to cut, good to cut. There is a hole between the 34 and the 41. Still clear to your right rear. 77, half out of line, back there, inside middle, middle here, middle, middle. Still middle here, still middle, still middle, still middle. Still mid, still mid. Clear behind 77. Middle, keep making there. Still middle. Still middle. Cut it, cut it, cut it, yep, cut it with him. Still outside 77, 30, still bottom, he cut. Clear right rear, clear high, clear low. Clear everything here, clear everything. Still clear. Top lane is closer here. Still clear to the middle. Two in, two in, two in. Two inside, two inside. Now good to cut all. They cut. Going to be two inside again. Still two in. Point two spinning underneath you, you're good, you're good. Caution, going to be out here, caution, caution. I don't believe this fucking shit, man, back here. There's just nowhere to go. And I feel like the top is fucking me off back here, it's just all the shit is going to the top. I agree. I think we can go back to favoring the bottom here. Copy. Also, we're still tight. Heavy traffic, we're tight. Be extended here, squid. 10-4, copy. Thinking you, squid. They definitely stay out if anybody does pick, we can pick up a few spots. I just don't know that they will. Can you imagine, the more back we go, the worse things arrive later. Alright, we're thinking when it does open, if we can get in the top 15, we'll stay out, if not we'll come back. We'll put two lab pressure tires on it. We can make an adjustment for you if you think you need it. I don't know if we need it or not. I mean, it's so hard to charge the car just by, you know, crazy resource like that. I don't know. I don't know what to do. I mean, the front definitely is tight, but I don't know what the car is going to do once I get that little more thread up. Most likely it's going to be the same as before, but I don't know. Yeah, 10-4, agreed. If we can get in the top 15, we'll stay out, if not, let's at least put fresh tires on it. Open this time. No. You keep them closed here. If we can top 15 and stay out, if not, let's do it. Stay out. Stay out. It's going to be right around 15. Rebecca 2 is P-15. With tires behind you, do you want to favor either direction or do you want to just stick to the bottom here? I don't know. Whatever the data says. Whatever the data says, I just...I mean, I think you're right. I think the tires are going to make the before just to go to the outside. Still looks like... We'll show it, Tom. So, number is 7. It's just the way the data is playing right here. Using this time, we are at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Take the top. One in your mirror, 38 here inside. I believe the 38 is on either rights or fuel only, I believe. It was fuel only last time. You said they can make it. Make sure they're cleaned up here. Work them good. 100 to go at the line. Take top. We're 10 away. 5 away. 2, 1, green. One tight on your bumper. Line. You're good to cut. Good to cut. One's cutting. Right with you, though. Still one right tight to your left. You're two in. Two in. One of them is way down low. Clear the middle. Outside and inside way down low. Two in. One of them is way down low. Oh, boy. Clear the middle. Outside and inside way down low. Inside's way down low. You're going to clear it outside only. Outside only here. Still clear behind. 41. Clear up. One tight on your right rear now. Back to the middle. Still middle. Still middle. Still mid. You're pulling the 5. You're going to clear the 5. Inside only. Good to cut. Inside only. Good to cut. Inside only is a 38. Both lanes coming at you. One back now. Half back. Clear to 38. Outside only to 48. Clear behind. 48 here. Clear to use the whole racetrack. One. The one's baited. 5 is tighter to you here. Inside's just a 41. Clear bumper here. Clear low. Clear low. Clear low. Clear to cut it all. Clear to cut it. They all cut. Clear to cut. You've got to play a little deep inside now. Clear. Clear. Clear. Still three lanes behind you here. Got one spinning here. Come high. Come high. Come high. Come high. Come high. Blue is out. Start. 41. 48. 99. 5. Might open here, Squid. What do you think? It's open. Open, Squid. Let me know. Nothing from you, Squid. Pit here. Let's pit here. Four tires. Pit here. Pia here. Second gear all red. This will flip a lot of track position here, bud. A lot of them will flip. Second gear all red. 3, 2, 1. There. Plus 9 here. If you took 2, just F5. Right side's here. Right side. Blue's 3, 2, 1. Right side. Blue's. Seven blues here. Right side. Coming around the 45. That's the last one. You are 508. 4, 3, 2, 1. Right side tires here. Right side tires. What are some of them doing? Right? We're out behind them. How many of them are? How many of them are? Reds. Reds. Whites. Whites. Whites. Two whites. Good. You can save a little fuel under caution. A little saving while you have the opportunity here. Just a little saving please. Yeah, gonna be a big mix up here. 19 is not pitted since the stage. Cannot make it on fuel. Then the 41 pitted with us. Gonna be tight. And then I'd say the rest of them have pitted to caution before. Probably pretty close to good now. 13 overall. Get ready to get caught up here. I think it's all the way in front of the 31. Coming to choose here. The number here. Favoring top right now. That would be 6. Choosing right here. Choose number 6. Leader is taking the top. We're at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Take the top. The 45 who's been second best car all day on 4 tires behind you. Inside lane I believe is a 5 on 2. Then the 24 will be on 4. So you said the 45 is on 4 too right? Yeah, I would believe so. Yeah, we just got 5 laps on our left. We only got like 3 green flag laps on your left. Maybe less than that. Should be fine here. Make sure your right front is cleaned up. Left front is cleaned up. Might fire just a little tighter with the stickers on the right. That clean air, you know the 23 is going to be going forward. The 47 in front of him has been one of the worst cars all day. 10 away. 5, 2, 1. Waiting, waiting. Green. Tight front, tight. Tight, tight, tight. Line. 45 is inside here. 2 inside. Be ready to protect your right rear. 2 in, 2 in. You cleared the 45. Now it's the 5. It'll be the 47 if you get there. Still 2 in, way down low. 2 in, way down low. Keep that momentum on the 47 here. Still 2 in, still 2 in. Still 2, still 2. Still 2, still 2, still 2. Still 2 in. All cut. He chased it down. Chased the cut with him. Still 2 in. Way down low below the 5 here. Still 2 in. Come on.

You cleared everything here. Cleared it all. Whatever you need. Coming back at you here. 2 in. All good. Get your momentum back. All good. Clear behind him. That's how you get aggressive. Stay out there on him. Back to 2 in. They're going to stall you out so still 2 in here. Still 2. Still 2 in. Still 2 in. Both cutting. 47 partial cut. Still 2 in here. Still 2 in here. Now 1. Just 1 in. Just a 6. Just a 6 inside. 6 inside tight here. Use your momentum. Still inside just a 6. Just a 6. Clear behind the 6 here if you need it. Stay all cut. Still clear all the way across here. 2 back to 3 wide. Still clear all the way across here. That's middle if you make it. Make sure they know you're there if you get there. Still all clear. Tight here up with a 10. Still clear. Still all clear here. This will be tires behind you. 4 tires. Your pace will level off here. Good momentum off of 2. 1 lane higher. Half back. Half back. Half back. 1 lane higher. Run coming. Still clear. Still clear. Still clear. Still clear. Still clear. Outside now. Outside here. Still outside. Pull him back. Don't let him cut it. Don't let him cut it. Not cutting behind you. Still out there. Just a 10. Just a 10. 20 tight here left rear. Clear behind the 10. Get up. Get up. Protect the 45 here. His run is going to come to you quicker. 20 is inside. Here comes the push. Here comes the push. Still inside. Still inside. Going half a lane higher. Still clear. Clear. Clear. 12 working bottom lane. Half back. Still clear on him. Just keep stalling him out the best you can here. It'll start to flat out. These guys in front will come back to you. 12 is closer. He cut. Will not get to your left rear. Back. 1 back to the very top. Half back to the 45. You are clear. You are clear to take it. Still clear. Still clear. Now outside. Outside. 2 lanes off here. Still outside. Run coming. Still out there. Momentum with him. 5 back behind. Just you and the 45. You are clear behind him on exit. You and the 12 are inching away from the 5 right now that's playing defense on the 11. These guys are going to start falling back to you. The wounded 43 car up here. All clear here. 12 just trying to build big runs. He's making a big arc into 3. Trying to exit lower on the 4. 2 to the very top. He's just trying to build runs right now. Going to be as close as he's been here with the biggest run. Still over 1 back. 38 are going to hold this whole pack up. Randleys to half a lane lower all the way through there. No gain though. Don't overdrive your entry to 3. Get the speed knocked out of it so you can wrap that line. Be disciplined for me here. Still all clear here. Still 2 to 3 back. Just running the upper lane opposite of you. Going to have to start playing a little bit of defense on the 11. It's 10 back from him. Just cleared the 5. Keep doing this work right here. The 11 went to that early high entry into 1 with an early apex. He's in there right now. You know what he said there? Not exactly. I think he's more just doing what he's got to do right now. Copy. Slow 43 coming back again. Clear. Still all clear here. All clear. Clear. Clear. He's just really starting to send in trying to build a run. He ran top in 1 and 2 last time. He did the early high entry. Still in line. You saw him there. They just apex earlier and enter higher. One lane lower here. Still all clear. Inside bumper. He's way down low though. Clear. Clear. He's out of line. You're clear. He's going to dive. Diving in. Still in there. Clear. You're all clear. You see they're going to be too wide in your mirror now. He's going to drive by us as soon as he gets to us. He's way better than the 12 right now. Still clear here. Way down low. Bumper. Clear. Clear. Still clear here. Half back. Inside here. Inside quarter. Quarter. Bumper. Inside here. Inside. Still in there even. He wants to take his run and go right back at him here. By 2 to the 11. Half to the 11. Good exit though. You stretched to 1. 50 to go here. 50 to go. He's cutting to try to get to your inside. Inside here even. Still just you and him here. Momentum to you right now. Still inside here. He's pulling you back. Still inside. Still inside. Not cutting at all. Still inside even here. Still inside. Two lanes lower. Still above the yellow line though. Inside. Clear. Really tight to you there. Trying to go move you. Clear by 1. He's got company from the 5 now. We're not supposed to be hard on that. I did not copy. We're not supposed to be hard on that. Inside bumper here. Inside quarter door. Inside even. Low 43 up here. You shouldn't get to him until exit of 2. Just you and him. Still clear behind him. Still all clear. You and the 5 are on the same tires. You've outrun him all day. Got a big group of them up there you can chase down that are on older stuff than you. You got fuel? We're all good. Still all clear here. Yes we are good on fuel. There's a couple that are going to be closed up front. 5 is trying to partial cut here. Still clear. 3 to 5 in front of us. Can't make it. We think 3 to 5 cannot make it in front. Still tight here bumper the 5. Come on. Run your best lap times here. You'll drive away from him. Bit better than him all day. Little less worry on air block here. Give me some lap time. You don't have to worry about air block. You keep running these laps right here. About 2 to 3 pence faster. 34.38.41 up there. You're chasing the 11 down here. That's been the best car all day. Clear. I hear some guys starting to use fifth gear just trying to save a little bit of fuel. So might be a couple more that can't make it. We're still good. 38 is coming back. 3 to 4 tenths a lap. That's going to put us to P12 when you get to him. 31 is on 40 lap pressure tires. Just don't cost time by side drafting him here or something. I'm down 2. Down. Outside. Outside. Clear behind him. Go 2 into that gap to the 38 right here. What you think can't make it up here. Still out there. Clear. The pace is slowing down. They might not make it. Little vibration. Copy. They're ready if you need it. Talks of it and it's the build up in the wheels with the call is on you. I don't know what the hell they're running in 3 and 4. Most people are on the bottom when they have clean air. Trying to run the bottom when they have clean air. I was just searching both ends. He's going opposite of you every time. Good 3 and 4 though. Really good. The 38 is kind of eating both lanes. They're doing that super early high apex. Entering really high. Where did you go? 5 is getting the top better through 1 and 2 right now. 5 is going to try to build a run to both of you. Door quarter bumper bumper bumper. Bumper clear. No run behind him yet. You're clear half. You're clear 1. Went to block the 5's run right here. You're clear by 3 to him. Alright come on. He's got to lock in for 18 more right here. Give me some gap. We'll try to defend on the 5 a little bit. I'll let you know where he's at. He's running top. As soon as we get a couple more car lengths here it's going to be all about lap time. You're going to chase that 10 down. Going to be clear by at least 10 here. The 5 pretty much direct to 38. He can run higher. That's pretty close to what the leader is doing though. That's 2 and a half tenths faster than those guys. You'll be there with 5 to go. Got to keep running 20 though. 10th better than them. Back to 10. Chewing into that gap. Really slow right here. They're going to catch some traffic. Go right here. The 5 is going to start getting some company from the 19. It is for position but he's on 30. That's the lap time I need though. Keep that up. Come on. Probably prefer to stall to 19 if possible. That's bottom lane. Now you've got to make best lap time here. I'm not going to hold the 19 back here inside. Just 2 good tires. Inside even. Good momentum up at 2 so we can hold the 5 back. 1 back to the 5. Half lane higher. Still clear. Still clear. Protect it. Protect it. Tight to your bumper. Tight bumper. No run. You're driving away. Inside bumper. Clear. Inside. Way down low. You're going to be clear. Clear. You're doing a really good job. Driving away. You're 3 to go. Trying to work back to the bottom here. Inside bumper. He's getting tight though. Moment of view. Clear. Still all clear here. Half a lane higher. Clear. Coming back to the white flag here. Diving to the bottom. Inside bumper. The 11th moving to 10 up here. Inside bumper. Inside. Clear. Clear. Clear. He's going very top shelf here. Half back. Still clear here. Still clear. Clear to take it. Still clear. By 1 here. And line tight. Going half a lane higher. 1 lane higher. Still clear. Easy. Yep. Clear here. Clear. Just watch him in front here. Clear. He got tight behind. Checkers. Speed 13 there. Good fight today. I don't know. I was traveling a little bit. It was a little bit better but not a lot. I don't know. It was a little bit more disconnected than yesterday for some reason.
