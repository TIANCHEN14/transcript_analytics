All right, Kyle, let's have a fire. Don't be ready. First crew, start and roll. Like normal, we need to re-index the wheel. Do it off a two down the back, please. If not, we'll line up inside lane behind the pace car. All right, bit road speed right there. Good look at it. Yeah. Hard to tell. We'll just do it on pit road. Ten four, copy that. Pace car should pull down here off a turn two, allow us to get caught up. We'll start getting single file. This will be our lap to come down pit road to get a look at our speeds. Here we go. Second gear, all red in three, two, one. Now, all red. All red. Camera line here. Last line now. Ten out of ten there. Copy that. The first two sections were a little light. 48.8 on the first two sections on pit road. Mostly 49, 50s and 60s from there on out. Section 13, the next to last section was your hot section, 49, 76. That 49, 76 is a hot section, just so you know. Ten four, Derek, just call that. Rest of the day, hot. Okay, ten four. Just so you're aware where it's at, it's pit stall two where the 47 is. It's from that to where the camera line is. That's that hot zone, but I'll call it out all day. Come back to the one to go here. 267 laps, racing lap 80. Just like we were here in the fall, just four at a time here. We'll be there at the end. Have a good day. Okay. That was very scratchy and crackly. One, two, three, four, five.

I got to know that I'm clear. You just always pretend like I'm going to do something stupid. Copy that. We're going to get a yellow here. Got one slow down the front. Still green. Cautious though. Cautious though. Talk to me about your car there. Really bad blowout. Holy shit bad blowout. Copy that. If we pit here, it'll put us really really close to making it to the end of the stage. So I think you got to almost dead here. Yeah, just really tight center behind somebody. Clean air it's fine. It's got good balance and clean air but just really tight in traffic. Keep me posted on two here. Pit road still closed. This time closed. Keep your visor closed down the front here. Got a couple sweepers up top. I did say clear bottom but I'll just say it several more times and use the car number or if that's what it's going to be that helps you. Yeah, maybe like clear all lanes or something like that because I think at the start of the race like lap two or something we came off of four and I knew we were three wide. You never said that's three. You know, bottom of three. Dead here, dead there for four. Ten four. Regardless whether they all stay out in front of us or not. Ten four, pit. Alright, pit road will be open this time. Pit here. Put four on it. I'll put four on it. Pit here. Put four on it. I'm sure there will be some guys that do too but that's a long way. You know, it's about 65 laps to go on tires there and we're already tight so I'm going to put four on it. Alright, you'll have a clear in here pitting this time. Second gear, all reds 45 is pitted ahead of you on pit road. Single file here. Single file. All reds now. Ten away. Going to stop a little short here. Five away. Four, three, two, one.

Second gear, all reds. All reds. Hot zone in two. One now. Hot zone. Hot zone. All reds now. Sorry about that guys. Pit road is slinked there. I slipped and lost hot dead center. Good man. Hey save me all the fuel you can. This puts you like everybody right on their number to make it to the end of this stage. So just save me all the fuel you can here under these cautions. I'll try and air out here for you. Alright, race has started. Let's go. Didn't lose anything there. Still p17. One seven. It'll be one to go when you get back. We'll take the green at lap 15. Going to lap 80. Position p17 choosing this time. Five. Looks like they took two tires there. And just so you're aware of it, sounds like the top five took two tires there. 17, 14, 7, 45, 99. P17 choosing this time. 17 the leader. Chose bottom. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Alright, just like the start of the race we'll have the 40 gauge here too. Rear's cleaned up. Good clean shifts. Everything above that solid white line till our tail cross the start finish. Face cars away. Rear's 10 away. Five, 48, laying one off again. Ready, ready, ready, green, green, green. All rolling good. Still one off 48. I'm clear behind the 77 if we need it. Half back two, I do. Back to outside lane being full. Half back three wide.

Three quarter off. Half off. Still inside. Bottom clear. One back two by two. Two in front of me either. One back half up. One. 48. Quarter. Bumper. Bumper back to your door. Pull on up. Two back. 21. One back one up. 21. Momentum coming. Three quarter. Half. Two feet. Outside bumper. Clear. Clear. You got in the wall. By two. Door. Quarter. Bumper. Clear. Clear. By one into three. Good set of corners. Three and four. Good by six. By five. Behind. Just you and the 34. Still outside door. Still inside bumper. Hanging bumper. Two lanes down. Clear. Clear. By five in front. Four out the back. Good exit. Could be by six into one. By five. Car at the wall up here. Watch for debris coming across the track. Stay low. Stay low. Stay low. Yellow's out. Yellow's out. No difference there. No lots of boilouts I'm assuming. It's better, but like it's better too late. Like when it needs to help me, it needs to help me not as severe but earlier. So I don't know. I still go in the corner and I land and I'm tight kind of sliding up the track and then I get the right rear outside the right front and then it's turning down the hill. So I don't know. Tracking anything in front of me is horrendous. Yeah, copy. So I feel those guys that took two are still hanging on up there. I think we might pit here. Just unless we can grab a bunch of track position. It's about the same amount of laps you had. That's 11 laps. We only had nine laps on it a minute ago when we pitted. Still closed this time. Closed. The problem is three. Like I can't get into three and get turned early enough. By the time it turns it's too late. You know, like I just lose too much time into three waiting. Yeah, that's definitely where we're getting killed at right now. And if I can go in on the bottom with clear racetrack in front of me, I can dive into the bottom and it'll rotate and do what it needs to do as long as no one's in front of me. But I can't follow somebody into the corner. Yeah, it's considering rights but I'm worried about being way too tight if we do rights, don't we? We'll have at least another lap to think on it here. We've got to get the record for the 17 up hit road. Had any right rear slip problems at all? Yeah, a couple. It's kind of when the front wakes up and turns late exit or it turns and then a little bit later exit I can lose the back just a titch. Alright, it's going to be even longer now. We've got to get the welding truck over here for where 17 hit the wall. Still closed this time. Alright, pit road will be open this time. We're exit two. I think you have to take two. I think there's going to be so many between me and the two tires that take two. Turn three, Randall. Copy, two tires here. Two tires. Alright, pitting this time. This is 34 pits. He's pitted before you. He's pitted five behind you. Alright, single file here. Everybody coming. Second gear, all red, two, one. Now we'll have a clear in. Stop at your sign, 10 away. Five, four, three, two, one. Go, go, go, go, go, all the way out, all the way out, all the way out. Second gear, all red. All red. All red. Hot zone in two, one, now. Hot zone, hot zone, all red, now. Alright, that's P2 off pit road. We have four cars stay out. I'm sure that 44, the last one that stayed out, will pit. I'll meet you up with a little bit of wedge and a little bit of air pressure here for the two tires. Hopefully that'll get you going a little better to take off with. 99, that's the leader. The last stop he had taken two and he just stayed out. The 34, you've been running right around him. So you know he is the 42 who's been right at the very back of the pack. So just be aware of that here when we choose the 19s. Right up around the top eight, top ten. Alright, I think I'm bringing us to a stop at the end of the back stretch. The welding truck needs to get down to the flat to be able to run. Run out there, daddy. I don't know if it's the first time welding or what, but it doesn't look like it's getting a whole lot done at the moment. Sure. I mean, mine might look like goovert up shit if I did it, but I'd have it done, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. I'm just up here during my off time here reading the book of how to be a spotter because apparently I forgot. I'm just kidding, I just think it's funny. Alright, they said to go and fire them back up. We can wait until you see the base car roll off if you want to. It'll be one to go when you get back. This will be the Choose T5. Just remember what I said about the 42 there. We'll take the green in lap 35, race in lap 80. Two stayed out, right? Correct. It's on four from the previous yellow though? Yes, yellow, er, four from the previous yellow, yes. The 99 is on two from the previous yellow. Alright, T5, choose on this time, 99 leader. Choose bottom, one. Two. You'll have the 24 to your tail. Get your tires good and cleaned up all the way back around here. 24 to your tail. On that last start he took the five top of three and was able to get around all those guys on that last start. Just be ready for that here, get into one. Rear's cleaned up, good clean shift, control car down bottom. Base car's away. Away. Five, tucked up tight out the back, get ready, ready, ready, green, green, green, green. All rolling good, tight out the back, he's going to push on 23, line down, on you straight. They're locking together in front of you, still on you straight. 23 still pushing him hard, still on you straight, he's going up ahead, light up. Middle of three now, middle of three, still outside quarter, still outside quarter, middle three, quarter. Drawback even, 23 with you half off, still middle three, still middle three. Two lanes between up there to the 24 at your quarter, still middle three. Top, one in front, still inside quarter, still inside bumper, bottom clear, half off, one down. Outside even, 42. One back, one up, five, clear on accident behind the 42's bumper, clear, clear. One off, he's got a toe up to you here, half, still one lane up, half off. Little run up there, outside bumper, outside quarter, outside door, he's going to try to push you middle three here. Bottom of three now, no pressure on the back by four, you can pull on five. Still bottom of three, tight middle. Still at your bumper, middle lane, clear middle lane, clear all the way, all the way, one and a half. Four and a half, by three on entry, nothing in front of either, one by five, good by three behind, still two by two in your mirror. Still by three to two by two, still five in front of any, bottom of three entry, bottom of three, middle lane clear, top is full, 34 only, quarter, bumper clear, take it, take it, take it. Half off, two by two, out the windshield by four. They've been coming here, they're racing hard behind you, good by seven when you get to them, still seven. By eight, they're back to single file now behind you, closed up to four back, they're nose to tail pushing each other to you. Two back bottom on exit 19, one back split to the bottom, inside quarter, inside bumper, clear off, all clear. One back five, clear in the 19, out there even, door, quarter, bumper, if you see it, take it, still bumper, the five's gonna get momentum off that top lane, he's with the 99. Watch for the split, he's coming down one lane, one back, half back, going back to the top, still two by two, inside quarter, 99, bumper clear, half back, one up, one and a half all the way. Five is the only one maintaining pace with you right now, good by three. You are by five on entry, he ran right sides, top hash, chopped his exit, beat you by two down the back, good by two. Two lanes up, right sides, top hash, two and a half off, still clear off, two and a half. You're by two, he's by ten. One up by two, one and a half, crossing over to your lane, one off. Three quarter, one down, half to one down, driving up to you tight, still clear. Got tight behind you, no pressure, pull in, by three on exit. Still by three, he's gonna beat you by one down the back, he's right sides, top hash again, by two on entry. Two back, one up on that half, still clear exit. Momentum's gonna come to you late here, passing start center, find a one, good by one and a half. One up, one back, half back, momentum's coming short, two feet, two feet, still clear in line tight. Two back, one up, you beat him by entry that time, one and a half exit. One lane higher, three quarter off, split down to one lane lower, still half off. One up, one back, three quarter, one up, half, one up, still clear off. Closer to you this time, a corner entry, one and a half, one up. Pull on him, out to two on exit. You're by three, he's by fifteen. He's gonna beat you by one from that one lane up again, he's gonna beat you by one, by two on entry. No gain, ran your line, three and a half. He ran right side, top hash again, only gonna beat you by one down the back, two and a half entry. To the bottom this time, no gain, still two and a half. By two he went to the bottom. Really good five eighths marked exit, discretionary by one and a half, last time he got off by two, gonna be by four and a three. He only beat you by about three quarters of a car lane, getting into the middle, and then you pull that plus two off of two down the back. Four and a half. Ran the bottom, beat you by two that time, back to two and a half, he's by twenty. One back, dive at bottom, half to the bottom, still clear. He's close enough to get there if he dives bottom this time, by two. Going one up, two and a half off. He struggles on that middle lane, three and four, beat you by half only down the front. Three here. Back to that, good one and two, back out three. Still three, no gain. Twenty-five to go, by two. He didn't pull down as much as he did previously, beat you by one down the back. He'll be the closest he's been in a while, through one and two, beat you by half off of four, one and a half entry. One up, two off, one and a half, big run coming, one, stalled out at once, still clear. Still one split, half lane down, lay dark to the bottom, one and a half, one down. He'll be the closest he's been again, three-quarter on entry. Split to the bottom, still half off on one. Good momentum, two and a half. That was good for your three-quarter, you stalled him out at the three-quarter. Out to three, he's still by twenty-five. No gain from your lane, still three. Beat you by one that time, by two. Lay dark to the bottom, still two, small gain off of four, gonna close up one. One back, one down on the flat. Stalled out at one. One back, one up, three-quarter, momentum coming half, he's gonna get there this time. Outside bumper, quarter. Clear, clear, forty back to the forty-five. You can roll all the way to him, still forty out the back, still outside door. Half lane between, he's gonna come down a pull, tight quarter. Back up to him. Outside even. Clear, clear. Doing good here, eighteen to go. We're still by thirty to the forty-five, he's bouncing speed, he's bottom of both ends. But he's shallow, hooking the line early into one, rolling into the last set of hash marks off of two. There. Tight, forty to sixty, both ends. Ten-four, they copy. Clear, a little bit more out of the track through three and four, lack of grip, three and four. See all that? There you go, really good on your release point right there off of two. Better through one and two that. Clear, clear, that was better on FFT as well. Fifteen to go, one-five. You cleared the forty-five that lap and you're a tenth there than the five. Oh, nine in front, thirty behind. Ten in front, seventeen behind, good-bye twenty. One and two's out line. Again, you're a little quiet there. This whole lap right here was really good. This whole lap was really good on FFT here, he's working twelve to go. Fastest car by almost two tenths. Probably better through one and two for us. Copy, it looks like it helps his entry to center roll of three and four as well. Braking even with the. Much better, keep working. Forty-three front, thirty-three behind, coming back to ten to go. Really good, chasing a forty-four. Back to eight to go. There has been a handful of guys half-leaning off the wall through three and four, so there is rubber up there. One and two, nobody's run higher than left side top pass. Eight to go, still by twenty. Fifty-two in front, twenty-three behind. Forty-five still making the bottom of one and two work. Five back, coming quick by himself. Still bottom, bottom. Two back, bottom. And lost all handle on this thing. Hang on for six more. One back. Half to the bottom, inside quarter. U-two by twelve. Five to go. One and two that time. They lost the car length to the two in front of them. Really good one and two this lap without center exit, one lane chop down by eight to the nineteen and fifty-four, four to go. Get loose exit where this thing needs to finish. Copy that. Just take care of it for three more here, we're going to be in the game once we get out of everybody's cycle. Goodbye three, he's got the fifty-four tight with him. Three back, one up. U-two by one on exit here. Two back, no scale tight. One back. Half, peeking out of line, inside bumper late. Fifty-four on the wall, three back, still inside quarter. Momentum cover from the fifty-four from the top, closing up quick, two back. One back, two to go. Half back, one lane up, one lane up, still clear. Up to your bumper tight, outside bumper. Your top, still inside full. With the nineteen by two, eleven, eleven's pressure is fifty-four now, still inside door. Still inside door, two back on the wall, fifty-four. Momentum's going to come from that top lane again, still inside door, here he comes, one back, one to go. Half back, going to split down one lane. Still inside, just two by two, no third lane. Still inside, eleven with you, three back, still inside door. Racing hard behind you with the nineteen by two, still inside quarter. Still inside quarter, eleven on the fence, three back. Two back, eleven, he won't get there, just nineteen only, still inside even. Checkers. Did you ever say we were coming back to it? Yes, I said one, one to go, white flag. Fuck me. I didn't hear it. You did a fucking fend off shit. You did a great job, man. Fighting off guys with four tires. You hang on for fifty laps, you had about twenty of them, man. What's in that game for us? I don't know what the radio issue is, every week, but it's a fucking problem. Building three here, on the exit there as you went, correct? I got all kinds of problems. First, it started building loose in, loose off. Then it started building tight center, then the loose in, loose off went away. Then the center got worse, then the exit got worse again, loose. Tighter center, looser off, just no grip. Copy that. I mean that's a lot of laps on the left side tires, probably about the longest you're going to have to carry them all day. So, just keep that in mind, I got you. We'll get you tuned up here, pal. Still closed this time, closed. So when you come in, you'll have the fourteen coming around you, so you might want to stop short, give yourself a little bit of room to get out, okay? Yes, sir. When we do pit, the nineteen is pitted ahead of you, on pit road, ahead of you. Still closed this time, closed. Take his hair off. Copy that, you want an ice pack or anything? Ice pack, tear off. Ice pack, tear off. I just want an ice pack, tear off. For reference, all three of those cars in front of you are pitted ahead of you on pit road. Pit road's open this time, pit this time. Just a reminder, those stalls are a little slick coming in. Stopping on your sign, fourteen be coming around. Alright, second gear, all reds, three, two, one, now all reds. All reds, ten away. Five, four, three, two, one. Go, go, all the way out, all the way out, all the way out. You got it, all the way out. All reds. All reds. Hot zone in, two, one, now hot zone, hot zone, hot zone, all reds, now. Do you see anybody making the wall work there at the end of that long run? I got the free pass coming around you here, and then you'll be good up. Just through three and four, that's why I relayed to you that a handful of guys have been running up there, so if you need to try something different when you caught the five, but obviously they're scanning and he did it first. But like the two, there was a couple other guys that were making it work up there, but they were obviously further spots behind us and in more traffic, but they were making it work. One and two, nobody's been left sides more than on top of the top set of hashes, one and two. Okay. Yeah, I heard you say it. I just, like when I tried it, I didn't really make up any ground. I get too tight in the middle and too loose off, so I'm not in the throttle going. No worries. I mean, I'm just giving you the info. If you try, if it doesn't work, you do what works for you. You know, that one time that you tried doing the early raft, like the 45 was doing the one and two, it wasn't good the first lap, but the second lap it was. It was just all, it's kind of like last year. Like if you're able to carry the line two car lengths longer, it was really good for late drive, but if you left it too early, then it was junk off the two and all the way down the back. It's all circumstantial. Simple. When we do get to choose, I wouldn't be overly worried about if you do end up having to choose behind the seven. He's actually been pretty good. He stayed inside the top ten that whole run last time. So that's not two tires? The seven. Is he two tires in front of us or no? The seven. The seven. That's four tires on the seven. There should be four tires on everybody. Three tires showed quite a bit of wear there. That's probably why it started going away so fast at the end. No cords on anything, just quite a bit of wear. All right. There'll be one to go when we get back. This will be the choose T5. We'll take the grand lap 88, and we are going to lap 165. Just like last stage, everybody will have to stop one time in this stage. All right. Choosing this time 19 liter, T5. Joe's bottom, one, two. You will have the 54 up top and 20 to your tail. I believe the 20 is on two. He was all the way in the back of the pack. No, he's on four. Never mind. He's on four as well. All right. Back in order here. A lot of race left to do. Pace cars away. Liters 10 away. 20 half off. Five away. Still half off. Ready. Ready. Ready. Green, green, green. Keep it all about the solid white line. Still half off. 20. Outside. Here comes the 20. Up to your bumper. Headlight low. Back in line straight. Top still full. Still outside. Top clear by three-quarter of the 54. Half front coming. Outside bumper. Outside door. 48 to one back in line. Be ready for a split. Here comes the 48. Three-quarter. Half. He's up in line with the 54. Top still full. Outside bumper. 48. Middle lane. Outside bumper. Just two by two here. Two back. One back. Big red coming. Split to the bottom. Inside bumper. 12. Middle of three. Middle of three. Still middle of three. Bottom lane clear. Top is full with the 48. Top's clear behind the 48. If we need it, two back to two by two. Outside even. Just the 48. You'll be clear on exit. Still two back to two by two. Keep your eyes peeled here. 12 trying to wreck the five. No pressure on the back by five. He's good by two in front. He had to check up a little bit. Clear bottom. Still five back. Bottom of three. 54. 48 outside. Bottom three. Bottom three.

Thirty-eighty-five in front. The five is a little better. It's holding the line a little longer off of four. Another good one and two. He's only beating you off of four.

Forty-five and nineteen starting to make ground up on the eleven out the back. They're about fifteen behind him running the fence through three and four. Twenty-seven in front. Thirty behind. The forty-five ran an O-five on the top of three and four. Three back on the fence. Clear exit. Fitting off of two. No yellow yet. Caution's out. Caution's out. Track will be clear when you get there. Gonna bring it to like a four or five lap shootout. Well that was an untimely caution there. I hear you on the air pressure deal. We're gonna make a little adjustment for that. If we're doing four here, I'd leave it alone for this run. I would try it next time we put tires on. I would not screw up short run right now. The road's open Randall. The road's open. Middle back. I think you gotta do four and then stay out at the stage break. You're gonna get like four or five laps here under green. That's my opinion. I think you'll have some guys do two here to try to get some stage points when he's done. Ten-four, pits are open. What are we doing? Tires. Four tires. Alright, gas is up here. Get ready to the tail of the one. Alright, take this time. Gas up to the five. Single file. Second gear all red. Now we're gonna have to stop short. Fourteen's gonna be coming around.

Or was it the forty-two? Can't ever tell. We start around the forty-three. Seven ahead of you. Good. Good. Good. So to lay out what we got for you with those early cautions, everybody's only got about two sets of tires in the pits right now so I don't... To make it to the end of the race, obviously you need at least one more because if it goes green you would only stop one more time. If we come in and get stickers now then that means we'll be screwed if we have a later race caution. I don't foresee anybody pitting right now. You said twenty-four six eight ninety-nine. He'd be the only one that would possibly pit right? He will probably pit, yes. Just heads up. Pit road's open. Middle back. Middle back. Channel two. We're in turn three. Stay out. Stay out.
