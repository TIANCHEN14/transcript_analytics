{"text": " Got a few here buddy. First pace cars rolling. I'll let you know when you get close. Alright about five, six cars are rolling here. Get close. Matt on two. I'll give him a ten away from you. Probably at the speed line where he switches there if that's okay with you. That'll work. Look left there. Just double check the number you told me earlier that you see nowhere it's at. Real good stuff. Good. I'm ready. Alright buddy. Second pace car is going to drop here off a two then we're going to get single file. We'll do our pit road run. You'll be really early here. Copy. Alright buddy. Second gear, three small. Red to start here. Make sure you give me gear and dots for sure every time TJ. Green or yellow. Yep. Will do. Alright you're about five away from the mark. Three, two, one. Second gear, three small. Red here. Yellow flag conditions. You are early here so I'm going to give you a ten away mark at the speed line on the front stretch over here. And you are there now. Ten away. Left three, two, one right here. Alright next time bye. Hi buddy. The first two segments were 49.4 and then the first straight segment was 47.71 and then 49.0 to 49.6 is the middle of pit road to the end of pit road right there. And the last segment was 47.76. Thank you buddy. Yes sir. Thank you man. Have some fun. Stay focused. Put it all together man. Let us know what you need. See you here in about sixty laps. One to go at the line. I think they just screwed up the start. I guess I thought if the leader didn't pick what lane he wanted to start into the one to go mark and then like Joey should have dropped from the outside row so the outside row should have moved up. I guess. I don't know. Whatever. Yeah I'm not sure. I mean maybe thirty-four was committed to the outside right away. But I think what you're saying is accurate. Yeah so the inside lane moved up Brad. Even though Joey was not on the pole. So they kind of messed that up already I think. So buddy, cover the green here. Leader is ten from the mark. He is five away already. Green, green, green. Rolling good. Rolling good. All good here man. Two apart out front. Thirty-one is right on here. Little defensive to the right rear. In your tracks. Just two by two here. Nobody got three wide there. Thirty-one is coming to you. Half apart out front. Bottom is stacking a little bit here. You're not rolling good. Bottom stacking. Seven car went three wide to the top of three. Two lanes back in your mirror. Going to have to watch that with the thirty-one. Go up high. Stay up high. Go up high. Get around it. Get around it. Get around it. Get around it. Then cut down. Go go. Speed up Brad. Go up. Go up. Go up. Go up. Clear. We're good. I made it through that. I didn't hit anybody but I did lock the tires up for good ways. Back in the field down here Brad. Just so you know, I don't see any debris buddy but there are black marks. I see debris in the middle of the corner. I'll show you where it's at. This main car camera is going to be really cool from that. Going to have to watch it again because I think I'm going to close my eyes. You feel like you slid the tires there? That's a thirty, forty percent mark of the corner. See the Coca-Cola sign down there? The billboard? It's in the middle groove right there. I think you're good through here. Yeah, it's at the Coca-Cola billboard. You'll come to the bottom there. You'll see it. All clear there TJ. So I can tell. All of you buddy go ahead. I think I'm going to watch this replay one more time but do we do see some left front lock up there? So we'll just check it here. Put four tires on it right here. Assuming everyone behind me is going to pit anyway. No half in there TJ. It might be hard to see but I think maybe lock both fronts up so we'll plan on when it opens put four tires on it right here. The forty-three maybe in his box so we'll stop you on the sign there. A little short. Showing red right now so I'm not pitting. Do not pit. It is red. It's not open. Do not pit. I'll tell you what it does. Pit roads are parked on my right now Brad. What happened there TJ? I'd love to tell you but I don't have any idea how it started. I'll try to see a replay when they show it. I'll let you know. Something happened BK with the three and the four maybe even nineteen accordion effect and they started all spinning out there and a couple roads back it looked like. Half the field's gone here. Check's up high in one. Still red. Still red. Should have known when Joey got that penalty they'd all wreck on the first lap. Shoot I knew when they didn't do the lineup right. Still a bunch of safety trucks up high in one as the jet dryer's blowing the track off now. It is still red here. Not open. The biggest thing we gotta do after this is get back in front of all those penalty cars so we don't give up those spots. Oh yeah. Ten-four. I gotcha. Brad they're dropping a car off on the straight road right now. I can see it opening maybe next lap there so just kinda be ready a little bit. Basically Matt everything behind the 22 is going to be a penalty car. Yes sir. TJ let us know if that 43 comes back in or not. Open this time Brad open this time here. Coming to you this time. This is here too. I think the 43 will be coming again Brad so on the sign for me please. And second gear three small red on entry here. There you go you have a flight conditions here. Three small red second gear. Coming around the corner to you boys. First car here. Remember you're 10 away at the line up here Brad. And you are 10 away on the sign. Five, four, three, two, one. Right here. Four tires on fuel. You're good Matt you're good. Flags are all the way. The one down there all good man. Do not speed here. All the way to the yellow down here. Sevens one car length off of you. Right there. Blend off of two. Brad when we do get the one or whatever and these guys stay out. 99 to 42 are too fast pit road here so. I don't know where these guys are going here but that's the last one you're clear up. Now Brad if we were to get one to go you're going to go all the way up follow him behind the four car. You guys will go all the way up behind the four. Every other car in front of you has a penalty. Alright get ready here. You're off to go because every car in front of you has a penalty. Just start going man. You have one to go next time. Come on. Go around the outside here. If he's not going to go we're going to go. These guys all have penalties. Come on. All the way to the four. All the way to the four. One's coming now. The one right there might not have pitted. You're correct there PJ. P15 Brad P15. Eight is our number but obviously it's a favor to the top here. It's a number. If I get to eight you go to the outside. Make sure we don't run over it up here. By date Carlene's past the finish line. Here's the number. One bottom. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six bottom. Seven bottom. The outside row here you're going to have a 71. 22 in your mirror. Yeah man the only thing I saw to be defensive of is the outside in a three.

Driving off the twenty four. Four back. Three back. Going higher. With a decent run here to the two. Two back. Going higher. One back. By himself. By himself. By himself. In line. In line. In line. He lifted. Rolled to the third lane. Two back. Third lane. Two back. Third lane. One back. Third lane. One. One. One. He found some grip up there. Wanted to do that last lap as well. I'm sure he'll go back to it. Nothing behind him. Nothing behind him. Three apart out front. Back to it. He's three back a lane higher. Yep. His left sides are on the top. Dot of line. I'm just too loose up there. I'm better than we were but still fighting the same thing. Bottom up here. You'll see him as the ten car. There. Two back a lane. One back. One. One. One. With you. Pretty much rim riding right there. Slow one on the bottom. There is nothing behind the two. About eleven to go. Three back a lane higher. Two a lane higher. He's on the top. One back a lane higher. Half. Half. He's there. He's there. He's there. He's there. Outside the two. He's the highest I've seen anybody. One back. All clear. Outside by the wall. These two have a history here. Lined up outside there. Lined up outside. Quick clear behind the two. If he gets you by two. By one. By one. By one. By half. Half. Inside seventy-one by himself. No run. No help behind him. No pressure out back driving off to seventy-one there. All clear. By three. All good. Three back to the third lane. The four. He maintained on entry. Yeah that's...it's coming in Brad up there on both ends. Right with you. The four. Seven's in here. Diving low. Inside the four. You'll see the four. All good. By himself. Door. Bumper. Bumper. Bumper. Still there. All good here. Just roll that middle and think it's stacked. Thirty-eighth two off. See you up top. Four is inside by himself. Should clear the four yet. Nobody down there here. Inside the four. Gotta come up high here. Stay up high. Crossers out. Crossers out. Go low. You're clear low. Clear low. Clear low. It's very fast for everybody. What I'm fighting with the most is still the same but you've got maybe you're sixty percent of it out. Okay. Ten-four. How about ride quality? No good game there. Ride quality's fine. Just need balance now. Hitting the track near as hard as it was. That was definitely a gain. I'm just that late center and exit pretty free and I can't keep the gas flows out. Okay. Ten-four. A little land tight in traffic but then I can navigate that. I can't navigate the loose. Especially if I want to go run the third lane. I just don't have the rear end grip to do that. It seems to help the car is when I slow a little bit. You know I just gotta get off the gas and slow my center. Slow the pace. Ten-four. I think we're gonna take our beddington right here and work on it again. Then it'll allow us at the stage break to do fuel only or stay out. So we're gonna work on the right front here again buddy. I like that the two car, he looks really strong and he can just charge into the corner and he gets tight in the middle but he's got good exit. He's gotta be really smart and not dump it you know. Well you did a good job there. You made some moves, got a good feel for us so we can keep working on it. It's all good. 43 will be pitting Brad so stop it on the sign here. Open this time. Yellow conditions here. We're set in the box again. Second gear Brad, second gear. What are we paying here? Second gear. Three small red. Alright at the line. Are you here? Alright, be coming to you guys here. Ten away. Five, four, three, two, one. Right here. All right, clear all the way. Good. We're gonna speed here buddy. All the way to the yellow. We'll blend off with you. I think we're already a four to go right here Brad so we are not getting the one to go yet. Yeah am I wrong? Looking at the pace and thinking the pace is stupid fast there Matt. It's like there's some 30 teens and 20s which was somewhere last year when everybody was pushing hard but it seems like everybody's pushing so yes I would agree the pace is pretty solid. So if these cars drop in Brad I have you 26th place on the track here. In line. 26th in line. Okay it'll be 25th in line with the 11 pitting there. Yeah he would have been pitting too soon there so. 12 TJ. 12. Alright buddy our number is 12. 12 or higher you go top. You're taking the bottom. One bottom. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Go top go away from the two. It's gonna be like a two lap shoot out. Yes sir. Checking the pace car I'm trying to get a piece of bare bond. They need to get it let us go green. So have to go on the stage now TJ? I mean two take it. Do it in line. You're back on. Yeah it's bare bond all over the back stretch from cars fixing their stuff. Going green next time bye. Shoot out here for the states. Yeah I mean I believe so yeah. Talked to the 43 told him probably not gonna press the issue too much right here force anything bad but buddy to the green. Leaders 10 for the mark. Leaders five away. Ready go go go. We're only good. 43 is not on you at all you're good. Everything out front here if you want to try to get those two or in front of us get that one and the other one they're all good man. All clear no pressure. I got everything in front of you man. Everything's good. Everything's fine. Everything's good here. Yeah everything's fine I'm watching them. No pressure you're clear by 10. 10. Everything's good. No pressure. Everything's good. Everything's good. Green checker right here all good. Pull safe. Pull safe man pull safe. We'll be staying out correct Matt? Okay what is the plan on staying out right here? Open next time staying out. The free pass is a three he's about 12 back Make sure you at least move up on the outside or he's working his way up. Right now Brad I think you're P12. I believe the 43 is pitting guys just so you know. Here where they're running TJ when they run to the top. Yeah left on that line three and four they seem to be a good the two got a bit higher in three and four like he was running the top top. TJ number will be six here. One way pick. Six. Brad the number is six it's not time yet but it is six. Here. Ah left on the white line on entry then yeah he was basically against the fence like against the fence yep right there maybe even higher I mean definitely higher right there he was I mean looked like you're running the wall. Good info. Yeah still not one to go not sure what we're doing here but ride around. All right the road's closed. P12 number is six.

I didn't want to get a penalty and it was my fault. You're good man. The one car got a penalty. All good Brad. Yeah the one car got a penalty. We didn't talk about that this week. I closed on fuel. Do I need to run apron? Yes sir. You're good buddy. We're going to be P7 in that stage there Brad. I shopped with the adjustments Matt. We're way, way closer now. Sorry about that man. Now. In the pit road or working on it. I kept trying to work with him but his car looks like mine did the second or third run. He just hasn't got to where I'm at. I agree man. How many people had issues? There's only 21 cars on the lead line. A bunch of penalties that whole last cycle that cost their bilaps. Good. Thanks for the update. Chris is rolling again. I don't think he lost a lap. Just remember Brad we will be yellow lights this time. Yellow flag lights this time. One way pit not green flag lights. I'm a light. Pair off if I can get one please.

Feels like Matt the pace is super fast here. Are you running? I saw like a 29.61 lap. I mean it was 29.70s there when it got spread out. Everybody wide open. You got SMP. Run me through the green flag stop again real quick. You know where the lap fraction is for pit entry. What was my speed at pit entry at the lap fraction please? I'd like to know so I can adapt. We're calling right now. 9825 on entry right there. I knew it was close. I gave back too much. Didn't want to chance it. Obviously BK. Front row here. Let's you see something different. Everything we've received for the restarts we've had. So Brad there's about 22 cars on the lead lap right now. Chris in the 34. They made a lot of pit stops there.
